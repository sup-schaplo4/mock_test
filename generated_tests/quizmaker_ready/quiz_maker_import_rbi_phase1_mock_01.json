The phrase 'along with its cautious outlook on inflation' is an additive phrase, not part of the compound subject, and therefore does not affect the number of the verb. The verb should agree with the singular subject 'announcement'. Thus, 'have' should be 'has'.

The crisis originated in the United States with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and quickly spread to other countries, causing widespread economic disruption. Banks experienced significant losses, credit markets froze, and many businesses faced bankruptcy. Governments and central banks intervened with massive bailouts and monetary easing measures to stabilize the financial system.

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

      "question": "The concept of moral suasion is often employed by central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India, as a tool to influence the behavior of commercial banks. It involves the central bank using persuasive techniques, rather than formal regulations, to encourage banks to comply with its policy objectives. This might include public statements, private meetings, or informal guidance. Moral suasion is most effective when the central bank has a strong reputation and a good relationship with the commercial banks. However, its effectiveness can be limited if banks have conflicting incentives or if the central bank lacks credibility. It is a subtle tool and its impact is often difficult to quantify.\n\nWhat is the central idea behind the use of moral suasion by central banks?",

      "explanation": "R is on floor 8, so U cannot be on floor 9 and must be on floor 4, making O on floor 3. N must be on floor 7, so T is on floor 4 and P on floor 6. M must be on floor 2, with Q on floor 5. Therefore, S, who is on an odd floor, can only be on floor 1, 5, or 9, but 5 is unoccupied.",

      "question": "Eight boxes labeled J, K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q are stacked vertically. They have items with two attributes: material (Wood, Metal, Plastic, Glass) and shape (Cube, Sphere, Cone, Cylinder). Conditions: 1) The Metal box is not at the bottom and is a Sphere. 2) The Cube is made of Wood and is three places below the Glass box. 3) The Plastic Cylinder is directly above the Metal box. 4) The Glass Cone is immediately above the Wooden Cube. 5) The bottom box is a Sphere. Which box is at the top?",
      "question_image": null,
      "type": "radio",

      "explanation": "The bottom box is a Sphere, so Box N is a Sphere, and the Metal Sphere cannot be at the bottom (Box N). The Cube must be three places below the Glass. If Box A is the Glass Cone, then Box B is the Wooden Cube. The Plastic Cylinder is above the Metal Sphere; hence Box O is the Metal Sphere and Box P is the Plastic Cylinder.
