      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

The crisis originated in the United States with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and quickly spread to other countries, causing widespread economic disruption.

Key elements of Basel III include higher minimum capital requirements, stricter liquidity standards, and measures to reduce procyclicality.

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation. The effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy depends on several factors, including the fiscal policy of the government and global economic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main function of the RBI as described in the passage?",

      "question": "Financial inclusion aims to extend banking services to the unbanked and underbanked populations. This involves providing access to basic banking accounts, credit, insurance, and other financial products at an affordable cost. Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have significantly increased the number of bank accounts, but ensuring their active usage remains a challenge. Digital banking channels, such as mobile banking and internet banking, are playing a crucial role in expanding financial inclusion, particularly in remote areas. However, digital literacy and internet access are essential prerequisites. Furthermore, addressing issues like cybersecurity and fraud prevention is vital to maintain trust in digital financial services. The ultimate goal is to empower individuals and communities by enabling them to participate more fully in the formal financial system.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is a significant challenge in achieving effective financial inclusion despite the increase in bank accounts?",

      "question": "Non-Performing Assets, NPAs, pose a significant challenge to the Indian banking sector. These are loans where borrowers have stopped making interest or principal payments for a specified period. High levels of NPAs erode bank profitability, reduce lending capacity, and can threaten financial stability. Several factors contribute to the accumulation of NPAs, including economic slowdowns, project delays, and willful loan defaults. The Reserve Bank of India has implemented various measures to address the NPA problem, such as asset quality reviews and restructuring schemes.

It involves the central bank using persuasive techniques, rather than formal regulations, to encourage banks to comply with its policy objectives.

Moral suasion is most effective when the central bank has a strong reputation and a good relationship with the commercial banks.

D is to the immediate left of C and faces away from the center. E is second to the right of D, and F is opposite to E. G cannot be next to B, and H is to the immediate right of A. Since G and H face the same direction, and we know the directions of other people, we can determine their directions. Final Arrangement (assuming clockwise order and starting with B):\nB(center) - _ - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H/G.\nKnowing all placements from above, H must be next to A and G cannot be next to B. Hence, the final arrangement is B(center) - G - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H.

      "question": "In an 8-floor building, floors are numbered 1 through 8 from bottom to top. Seven people - A, B, C, D, E, F, and G - live on different floors, with one floor remaining vacant. The following conditions are given: 1) C lives on the floor immediately above A. 2) B lives two floors above D. 3) There are two floors between G and E. 4) F does not live on the top floor. 5) A does not live on the bottom floor. Which floor is vacant?",
      "question_image": null,
      "type": "radio",
      "category": "Reasoning",
      "explanation": "Given that C is immediately above A, they occupy consecutive floors. B being two floors above D, means if D is on floor 1, B is on floor 3. G and E are separated by two floors; if E is on floor 4, G is on floor 7. F cannot be on the top floor, placing them on floor 8. Therefore, floors 2, 5, or 6 must be vacant. Since A cannot be on the bottom floor and logically deducing from placements, A is on floor 6 and C on floor 7, leaving floor 2 vacant.",
