                                <strong>Issue:</strong> The explanation incorrectly concludes that Q is on Floor 7. The correct arrangement should be: R - Floor 1, S - Floor 2, V - Floor 3, T - Floor 4, P - Floor 5, U - Floor 6, Q - Floor 7. However, the question asks which floor Q lives on, and the explanation arrives at the correct answer (Floor 6) through faulty logic. The correct floor for Q is 7, not 6.

                                <strong>Issue:</strong> The explanation incorrectly states that Course of Action I is relevant. The problem is poor customer service, so training customer-facing employees (Course of Action I) is directly relevant to solving the problem. The explanation also incorrectly states that Course of Action II does not address the root cause. While it doesn't directly fix the customer service issue, attracting new customers can help offset the loss of existing customers due to poor service. The correct answer should be 'All follow'.

                                <strong>Issue:</strong> The explanation states the pattern involves shifting consonants by +1 and vowels by -1. However, applying this to 'SKILL' results in: S(+1)=T, K(+1)=L, I(-1)=H, L(+1)=M, L(+1)=M. This gives 'TLHMM', not 'TMJMN'. The same error occurs for 'LOGIC'.
