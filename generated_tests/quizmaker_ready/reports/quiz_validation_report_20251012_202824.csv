While plausible, it's a significant claim that requires confirmation. (Suggestion: Verify the claim about India becoming the 3rd largest economy with reputable sources like the World Bank, IMF, or credible financial news outlets. Update the question and explanation accordingly.); Q8: This question is very similar to question 6. Both ask about India surpassing Japan to become the world's third-largest economy in May 2025. (Suggestion: Remove or significantly revise one of the questions to avoid redundancy.); Q9: The question asks about Q1:2024-25. While technically within the past year, it's becoming less relevant as we move further into 2025. The RBI Grade B exam often focuses on more recent economic data. (Suggestion: Consider updating the question to focus on more recent quarterly GDP growth data if available. If retaining, ensure the data is still accurate and relevant in the context of October 2025.); Q10: The question asks about foreign exchange reserves as of April 4, 2025. This data is somewhat outdated. More recent data would be more relevant for an October 2025 exam. (Suggestion: Update the question to reflect the most recent available data on India's foreign exchange reserves. If April 4, 2025, is the most recent available, consider noting that in the question (e.g., 'As of the latest available data from April 4, 2025...').); Q11: The question refers to September 2024 data. It is now October 2025, so the data is outdated and needs to be updated to reflect more current information or the question needs to be rephrased to be relevant to the current date. (Suggestion: Update the question with more recent data or rephrase to be relevant to the current date (October 2025).); Q12: The question refers to the 'Finance Bill 2025'. While it's appropriate for the current context (October 2025), it's crucial to ensure the information regarding the bill and its clauses is still accurate and hasn't been superseded by any amendments or new legislation. The period mentioned (1st April, 2011 to 30th June, 2017) is historical and should be verified for continued relevance. (Suggestion: Verify the accuracy and current status of the Finance Bill 2025 and the mentioned clauses. Ensure the historical period remains relevant in the context of the question.); Q13: The question refers to projected GNPA ratios for September 2024. This data is outdated as we are now in October 2025. The question needs to be updated with more recent projections or rephrased to be relevant to the current date. (Suggestion: Update the question with more recent GNPA ratio projections or rephrase to be relevant to the current date (October 2025).); Q14: The question refers to the policy repo rate set in February 2025. While relevant for the current context (October 2025), it's important to verify if the repo rate has changed since then. The MPC meets multiple times a year, so the February rate might not be the current rate. (Suggestion: Verify if the policy repo rate has changed since the February 2025 meeting and update the question and answer accordingly.); Q15: The question refers to financial soundness indicators for banks at the end of June 2024. This data is outdated as we are now in October 2025. The question needs to be updated with more recent data or rephrased to be relevant to the current date. (Suggestion: Update the question with more recent financial soundness indicators or rephrase to be relevant to the current date (October 2025).); Q18: References September 2025, but we're now in October 2025. The deposit base might have changed. (Suggestion: Verify and update the total bank deposit base in India as of the latest available data (ideally close to October 2025).); Q20: The question refers to the second half of fiscal year 2025-26. Since it's October 2025, the borrowing program for the second half of 2025-26 might be finalized and publicly available. The question should be updated to reflect the actual borrowing amount if it has been announced. (Suggestion: Verify if the borrowing program for the second half of FY 2025-26 has been announced and update the question and answer accordingly. If not yet announced, consider rephrasing to 'planned' or 'expected'.); Q23: The question refers to data from 'April – December 2024'. This data is outdated as we are in October 2025. The question needs to be updated with more recent data or rephrased to be relevant to the current time. (Suggestion: Update the question with more recent data or rephrase it to be relevant to the current time (October 2025).); Q24: The question refers to data from FY24. This data is outdated as we are in October 2025. The question needs to be updated with more recent data or rephrased to be relevant to the current time. (Suggestion: Update the question with more recent data or rephrase it to be relevant to the current time (October 2025).); Q25: The question refers to a Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held from October 7-9, 2024. This is outdated as we are in October 2025. The question needs to be updated with more recent data or rephrased to be relevant to the current time. (Suggestion: Update the question with more recent data or rephrase it to be relevant to the current time (October 2025).); Q26: The question asks about March 2024.

(Suggestion: Consider updating the question with more recent balance sheet data if available.); Q27: The question relies on a specific regulatory change. Verify if this change is still the most current and relevant one for the exam.

This question is about a past event. (Suggestion: Update to 'September 2024' or verify the actual date and amount of the loan agreement.); Q30: The question refers to September 2023. While the information might still be valid, it's getting old. Check if there have been any subsequent revisions or updates to these directions. (Suggestion: Verify if the September 2023 directions are still current. If there are newer directions, update the question accordingly.); Q31: The question asks about the MPC's stance following its October 2024 meeting. While factually correct now, it will become outdated soon. Consider phrasing it more generally or updating it annually. (Suggestion: Rephrase to be less date-specific or update annually.); Q32: The question refers to guidelines issued on September 12, 2023. While the information may still be relevant, it's important to check if these guidelines have been updated or superseded by newer regulations as of October 2025. (Suggestion: Verify if the September 12, 2023 guidelines are still current and update the question/answer accordingly.); Q33: The question refers to FDI inflows in 2024-25. This data will become outdated soon. Consider updating the question annually with the latest available data.

Consider updating the question annually with the latest available data. (Suggestion: Update the question annually with the latest available GNPA data.); Q35: The question refers to guidelines issued on April 26, 2024. While the information may still be relevant, it's important to check if these guidelines have been updated or superseded by newer regulations as of October 2025. (Suggestion: Verify if the April 26, 2024 guidelines are still current and update the question/answer accordingly.); Q36: The question refers to September 2024. While not strictly incorrect, it's best to use more recent examples or specify the relevance of this older event. (Suggestion: Consider updating the question to reflect more recent events or justify the inclusion of this specific event from September 2024.); Q39: The question refers to March 2025. It's now October 2025, so the information might be outdated or superseded. (Suggestion: Verify if the information about the trade agreement with the EU and BRICS expansion is still current and relevant. If not, update the question with more recent developments.); Q40: The explanation states that the GST council recommended a 2-rate structure, while the question and answer options are based on a 3-rate structure. This is a contradiction. (Suggestion: Correct the explanation to accurately reflect the GST council's recommendations and ensure the correct answer aligns with the updated explanation. Verify the accuracy of the proposed GST rate changes.); Q41: The question refers to FY24. While the information might be accurate, it's becoming historical. Consider framing the question to test understanding of trends or comparisons rather than just recall of a specific number from a past fiscal year. (Suggestion: Reframe the question to focus on trends or comparisons with other fiscal years.); Q42: The question refers to an event in December 2024. While the information might be accurate, it's becoming historical. Consider framing the question to test understanding of the impact of such measures or the context surrounding them. (Suggestion: Reframe the question to focus on the impact or context of the measure.); Q43: The question refers to events in March and August 2025. While the information might be accurate, it's becoming historical. Consider framing the question to test understanding of the current status or future plans for CBDC. (Suggestion: Reframe the question to focus on the current status or future plans for CBDC.); Q44: The question refers to FY24. While the information might be accurate, it's becoming historical.

(Suggestion: Update the question to reflect more recent fiscal year data when available.); Q47: The relaxation in interest rate ceilings is available until March 31, 2025. This date has passed. The question is still valid as a historical question, but its relevance is decreasing. (Suggestion: Consider updating the question to reflect current regulations or rephrase it as a historical question about the policy in December 2024.); Q48: The question refers to the RBI's December 2024 Monetary Policy Statement's projection for 2024-25. While correct in October 2025, a more recent projection might be available and more relevant. (Suggestion: Update the question with the latest available real GDP growth projection from a more recent Monetary Policy Statement.); Q50: The MPC would not have reduced the repo rate in February 2025. Given the current economic climate, it is more likely that the rate would have been held constant or increased. The correct answer is likely 6.50%. (Suggestion: Verify the actual policy repo rate set by the MPC in February 2025 and correct the question and answer accordingly. The explanation should also be updated to reflect the correct information.); Q53: The question refers to 'September 2024 Survey of Professional Forecasters'. It should be checked if a more recent survey is available for 2025.

This information would have been relevant earlier in 2025, but now in October 2025, it's becoming less relevant. The actual inflation figures for part of 2025-26 would be available. (Suggestion: Consider updating the question to reflect the current date (October 2025) and ask about actual figures for the available period of 2025-26, or projections for the remaining period.); Q72: The question refers to the period 'May 2022 to December 2024'. While factually correct based on the provided context, it's becoming increasingly outdated in October 2025. The RBI Grade B exam should ideally test on more recent trends. (Suggestion: Consider updating the question to include more recent data, perhaps extending the period to a more current date in 2025, or focusing on a different, more recent period of monetary policy tightening.); Q73: The question refers to the previous year '2022-23'. While the tax rate might still be applicable, it's becoming outdated. Candidates should be tested on more recent tax regulations. (Suggestion: Update the question to refer to a more recent previous year, such as 2023-24 or 2024-25, and verify the corresponding tax rate for that year.); Q74: The question asks about FY24 CAD.

quiz_maker_import_rbi_phase1_mock_03.json,PASSED,200,0,0,3,200,282.6,5.0,80,15,60,30,15,None,None,"Q198: The explanation incorrectly states that Linda is on the 2nd floor implies Irene is on the 3rd floor. The clue states Irene lives immediately *above* Linda. Also, the explanation contradicts itself by stating Monica is on the 3rd floor and then saying Monica and Irene can't share the 3rd floor, which is not a valid deduction based on the given clues. The correct deduction is: Linda is on the 2nd floor, Irene is on the 3rd floor, Monica is on the 3rd floor (given), which is a contradiction. Therefore, the question is flawed and cannot be solved with the given information. (Suggestion: Revise the clues to ensure a consistent and solvable puzzle. The placement of Monica needs to be changed or the clue about Irene living above Linda needs to be adjusted.); Q198: The correct answer is incorrect. With Linda on the 2nd floor and Irene immediately above her, Irene is on the 3rd floor. Monica is also on the 3rd floor. This creates a contradiction, meaning the puzzle is unsolvable as written. Henry is on the 7th floor. Kevin is immediately below George. Jessica and Kevin have two floors between them. The puzzle is flawed. (Suggestion: Revise the puzzle to ensure a unique solution is possible. The placement of Monica or the relationship between Irene and Linda needs to be adjusted.); Q199: The question is very complex and requires a significant amount of time to solve. While not inherently wrong, it might be too time-consuming for a typical RBI Grade B exam setting. (Suggestion: Consider simplifying the question or providing more explicit clues to reduce the solving time.)"

While still valid in October 2025, it's best to ensure the information is still current and relevant. (Suggestion: Verify the information about the Digital Agriculture Mission and AgriStack DPI is still current as of October 2025. If there have been any updates or changes, revise the question and answer accordingly.); Q7: The question asks about CPI inflation projections for FY 2024-25. Now that we are in October 2025, consider updating the question to reflect current projections or a more relevant timeframe.

(Suggestion: Check the latest RBI data for the most current foreign exchange reserves figure.); Q13: India's weightage in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is subject to change. Verify the weightage as of October 2025. (Suggestion: Consult the MSCI website or relevant financial news sources for the most up-to-date weightage information.); Q14: CPI inflation rates are dynamic. The rate for June 2025 needs to be confirmed against official government sources as of October 2025. (Suggestion: Verify the June 2025 CPI inflation rate with the National Statistical Office (NSO) or RBI data.); Q16: The question relies on hypothetical sovereign rating upgrades in 2025. These are speculative and may not reflect reality. (Suggestion: Verify the actual sovereign rating upgrades for India in 2025 and update the question accordingly. If no upgrades occurred, rephrase the question to reflect a different topic.); Q17: The question refers to the Finance Bill 2024. This should be updated to Finance Bill 2025 or the relevant year. (Suggestion: Update the year to '2025' or the relevant year for the current assessment period.); Q18: The question references a mid-term evaluation from December 2023.

This is speculative and needs verification. (Suggestion: Verify the actual amount released on October 1, 2025, and update the question accordingly. If the event did not occur, rephrase the question.); Q20: The question asks about the fiscal deficit of FY24. While the explanation mentions provisional actuals, it's crucial to confirm if final actuals are available and if they differ significantly. Also, consider if FY25 data is available and more relevant. (Suggestion: Check for the final actuals of FY24 and update the question if necessary. Consider including a question about FY25 if data is available.); Q21: The 56th GST Council meeting did not recommend a reduction of GST on Cement from 28% to 18%. The GST rate on cement remains at 28%. (Suggestion: Correct the question and answer to reflect the current GST rate on cement.); Q27: The 56th GST Council meeting likely occurred before October 2025. The information might be outdated. Verify the date and update the question if necessary. (Suggestion: Verify the date of the 56th GST Council meeting and update the question and answers accordingly.); Q28: The question refers to H2:2024-25.

(Suggestion: Update the timeframe to include more recent data or consider a broader historical perspective for the repo rate and CPI inflation.); Q41: The question refers to data from June 2024. While not strictly wrong, it's becoming less relevant in October 2025. Consider updating with more recent data if available. (Suggestion: Check for more recent GNPA ratio data and update the question accordingly.); Q42: The question refers to data from 2024. While not strictly wrong, it's becoming less relevant in October 2025. Consider updating with more recent data if available. (Suggestion: Check for more recent remittance data and update the question accordingly.); Q44: The question refers to the monthly accounts of the Government of India published in September 2025.

Leo attends immediately before Kelly, who attends on Sunday. Therefore, Leo attends on Saturday and Ivan attends on Sunday is correct. However, the conclusion that Jess must be on Monday is correct, but the reasoning in step 4 is confusing and could be clearer. (Suggestion: Reword the explanation to clearly show how Jess is determined to be on Monday after all other days are assigned.); Q192: The arrangement provided in the explanation is incorrect. Based on the conditions, the correct arrangement should be R U S P V Q T or its reverse T Q V P S U R. Therefore, T is at one end. (Suggestion: Correct the arrangement in the explanation to accurately reflect the given conditions. The correct answer is still T, but the explanation needs to be accurate.); Q194: Step II is incorrect. The smallest element in [1, 3, 8, 6] is 1. Adding 1 to each element results in [2, 4, 9, 7]. Step III correctly sorts this to [2, 4, 7, 9]. The correct answer should be [2, 4, 7, 9]. (Suggestion: Correct the calculation in Step II and the final answer. The correct answer should be [2, 4, 7, 9].); Q198: The 'Final Step' provided in the explanation is incorrect. The algorithm described is a single pass of bubble sort. The series is not fully sorted in Step V. The correct answer should be 'The sequence will never be fully sorted with this method'. (Suggestion: Correct the explanation and the correct answer. The question should be rephrased to ask for the state of the series after a specific number of steps, or the question should be changed to a different sorting algorithm.); Q200: The explanation for the encoding is inconsistent and incorrect. The example given for RAINBOW and SUNSHINE does not follow a consistent rule. The vowels are not replaced with their position in the alphabet, and the +1 shift is not consistently applied. The encoded value for 'MOONLIGHT' is also incorrect based on the described (but flawed) logic. (Suggestion: Revise the encoding logic to be consistent and accurate. Recalculate the encoded value for 'MOONLIGHT' based on the corrected logic. If the logic is intentionally complex, it should be clearly and accurately described.)"

(Suggestion: Update the question and answer with more recent core inflation data.); Q9: The question refers to the 56th GST Council meeting in September 2025, but it's currently October 2025. This implies the meeting has already happened, and the question should be based on past events. Also, the answer might be incorrect as GST rates are subject to change. (Suggestion: Verify the actual date of the 56th GST Council meeting and update the question and answer accordingly. Ensure the GST rate on Cement is accurate as of October 2025.); Q12: The SAARC Currency Swap Framework is mentioned as 2024-27. Verify if this is still the current framework in October 2025.

(Suggestion: Verify the current SAARC Currency Swap Framework and update the question and answer accordingly.); Q14: The question refers to the financial year 2024-25. Now that it is October 2025, this information is outdated. The question should refer to the most recent completed financial year.

It's crucial to verify if these projections held true and update the question/answer accordingly. If these are actual figures, the source should be explicitly mentioned. (Suggestion: Verify the actual borrowing amounts for Q3 FY 2025-26 and update the question and answer options. Add a source for the data.); Q17: The question refers to data as of March 2024. Given the current date of October 2025, more recent data should be available and used to update the question. (Suggestion: Update the question to reflect the most recent available data on post-pandemic recovery, ideally up to March/June/September 2025.); Q18: The question states the retail pilot of e₹-R was launched in March 2025. This needs to be verified against official RBI releases to ensure accuracy. (Suggestion: Confirm the launch date and number of cities for the e₹-R retail pilot with official RBI sources and update the question/answer accordingly.); Q20: The question states the share of floating rate loans in March 2025. This needs to be verified against official RBI releases to ensure accuracy. (Suggestion: Confirm the percentage of floating rate loans with official RBI sources and update the question/answer accordingly.); Q23: The explanation mentions 'Page 79, 209'. This implies the information is extracted from a specific document. It would be helpful to specify which document is being referenced (e.g., RBI Master Circular, Income Tax Act, etc.) for verification purposes. (Suggestion: Specify the source document for the penalty information.); Q28: The question refers to RBI's quarterly projections for 2024-25. Since we are in October 2025, these projections are outdated. The question needs to be updated with the latest available projections or a more general question about inflation targeting. (Suggestion: Update the question to reflect current RBI projections or ask a more general question about inflation targeting.); Q32: The question refers to the October 2024 Monetary Policy Statement. Since it is now October 2025, this information is outdated. A more recent Monetary Policy Statement should be referenced. (Suggestion: Update the question to refer to a more recent Monetary Policy Statement (e.g., October 2025 or the latest available).); Q33: The question refers to the financial year 2024-25. Since it is now October 2025, this information is outdated.  (Suggestion: Update the question to refer to a more recent financial year (e.g., 2025-26 or the current financial year).); Q34: The question refers to FY24. Since it is now October 2025, this information is outdated. (Suggestion: Update the question to refer to a more recent financial year (e.g., FY25 or the latest available).); Q35: The question refers to December 2024. Since it is now October 2025, this information is outdated. (Suggestion: Update the question to refer to more recent data or a more relevant timeframe.); Q36: The question refers to a period ending in 2017. While the information might be factually correct for that period, it's outdated in the context of preparing for the 2025 RBI Grade B exam. The relevance of this historical exemption needs to be considered. (Suggestion: Consider replacing this question with one that focuses on more current policies or regulations. If retaining, ensure its relevance is clearly justified.); Q37: The question asks about the projected real GDP growth for 2024-25 based on the first advance estimates. Since we are in October 2025, the *actual* real GDP growth for 2024-25 is now known, not just the projected estimate. The question is therefore misleading. (Suggestion: Update the question to ask about the *actual* real GDP growth for 2024-25, or rephrase to specifically ask about the 'first advance estimate' and clarify that it's a historical data point.); Q39: The question asks about the CRAR of NBFCs as of September 2023. This data point is over two years old. While it might be useful for understanding trends, it's not current information. (Suggestion: Update the question to reflect a more recent reporting period (e.g., September 2025 or the latest available data). If retaining, justify its relevance in understanding longer-term trends.); Q40: The question asks about the average headline CPI inflation rate during the financial year 2024-25. Since we are in October 2025, this data is now historical and should be presented as the *actual* inflation rate, not a projection or estimate. (Suggestion: Update the question to reflect that this is the *actual* inflation rate for the financial year 2024-25.); Q41: The question refers to events in 2024. While factually correct based on the provided explanation, it might be more relevant to focus on more recent MPC decisions for an exam in 2025. Consider updating the question to reflect more current events or trends. (Suggestion: Consider updating the question to reflect more current events or trends in monetary policy.); Q42: The question asks about the assessment year 2025-26. While the answer is likely correct based on current tax laws, it's crucial to verify that there haven't been any changes to income tax slabs or exemption limits announced for that assessment year as of October 2025. (Suggestion: Verify the income tax slabs and exemption limits for the assessment year 2025-26 are still accurate as of October 2025.); Q43: The question refers to 'the first half of FY25'. This is now historical data. While the answer might still be technically correct, it would be better to update the question to reflect the current economic situation or a more recent period. (Suggestion: Update the question to refer to a more recent period or the entire FY25, if data is available.); Q44: The question uses PLFS data from 2022-23. It's important to check if more recent PLFS data is available (e.g., for 2023-24 or a more recent period). If newer data exists, the question should be updated to reflect the most current information. (Suggestion: Check for more recent PLFS data and update the question accordingly.); Q45: The question refers to the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 2024. While the scheme name is correct, it's important to verify if this scheme is still relevant and active as of October 2025. There might be newer schemes or updates to existing ones. (Suggestion: Verify the continued relevance and status of the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, 2024 as of October 2025.); Q47: The question refers to FY24. This needs to be updated to reflect the current fiscal year (FY26) or the most recently completed fiscal year (FY25) and the corresponding FPI inflows. (Suggestion: Update the question to reflect the most recent fiscal year and its corresponding data. For example, 'What was the total value of net FPI inflows during FY25?' and update the answer and explanation accordingly.); Q49: The question asks about the projected real GDP growth for 2024-25. This period is now in the past. The question should refer to 2025-26 or the latest available projection. (Suggestion: Update the question to refer to the projected real GDP growth for 2025-26 or the latest available projection. Update the answer and explanation accordingly.); Q50: The claim that India surpassed Japan to become the world's third-largest economy in May 2025 with a GDP of $4.5 trillion is likely incorrect. As of October 2025, India is not the third-largest economy. This needs to be verified and corrected with accurate data. (Suggestion: Verify the accuracy of the statement regarding India's GDP size and ranking in May 2025. Update the question, answer, and explanation with the correct information.)"
