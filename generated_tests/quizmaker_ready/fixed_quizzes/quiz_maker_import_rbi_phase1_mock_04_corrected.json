       "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.What is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

       "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted.

It involves the central bank using persuasive techniques, rather than formal regulations, to encourage banks to comply with its policy objectives.

Moral suasion is most effective when the central bank has a strong reputation and a good relationship with the commercial banks. However, its effectiveness can be limited if banks have conflicting incentives or if the central bank lacks credibility. It is a subtle tool and its impact is often difficult to quantify.What is the central idea behind the use of moral suasion by central banks?",

These are loans where borrowers have stopped making interest or principal payments for a specified period.

       "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, as the central bank, plays a crucial role in managing the nation's money supply and credit. Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on several factors, including the responsiveness of businesses and consumers to interest rate changes and the overall economic outlook.What is the main goal of the RBI according to the passage?",

The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation.

We must eliminate the possibilities that conflict with other clues.Clue (3) says D sits to the left of A. If the block were in positions 1–3 (A=1, C=2, B=3), there is no seat to the left of A, so that placement is impossible.If the block were in positions 3–5 (A=3, C=4, B=5), then (4) requires E to sit to the right of B — but B would be at the extreme right (position 5) so there is no seat to its right. Therefore that placement is impossible.The only remaining valid placement is the block in positions 2–4: A(2) - C(3) - B(4).Clue (5) requires D to be at an end and clue (3) requires D to be left of A. The only end seat left to the left of A(2) is position 1, so D must be at position 1.That leaves position 5 for E, which also satisfies clue (4) (E is to the right of B at position 4).Final left→right arrangement: D, A, C, B, E.

Consider these conditions: 1) G lives on an odd-numbered floor below floor 5. 2) M lives exactly two floors above L. 3) J lives on the top floor. 4) H lives on an even-numbered floor, but not the 6th. 5) K lives immediately below H. Which floor does M live on?",

       "explanation": "From the conditions: G on 1st or 3rd floor, but only 3rd is left because J is on 7th. H can be on 2nd or 4th; if on 2nd, K on 1st, leaving no room for G, so H must be on 4th, K on 3rd, G on 1st. M is two floors above L; placing M on 6th and L on 4th satisfies all conditions.",
