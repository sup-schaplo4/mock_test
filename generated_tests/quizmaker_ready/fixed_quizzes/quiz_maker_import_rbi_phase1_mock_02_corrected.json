It aims to improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial stress, improve risk management and governance, and strengthen banks' transparency and disclosures. Key elements of Basel III include higher minimum capital requirements, stricter liquidity standards, and measures to reduce procyclicality. The implementation of Basel III has been phased in over several years and has had a significant impact on the global banking landscape. While it has enhanced the stability of the banking system, it has also increased compliance costs for banks and may have contributed to a slight reduction in lending activity.\n\nWhat is the primary goal of Basel III, as described in the passage?",

       "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates.

       "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

       "explanation": "Let the present ages of A and B be 3x and 5x respectively. In 5 years, their ages will be (3x + 5) and (5x + 5). The new ratio is 2:3. So, (3x + 5)/(5x + 5) = 2/3. Cross-multiplying gives 3(3x + 5) = 2(5x + 5). Solving: 9x + 15 = 10x + 10, which simplifies to x = 5. Thus, A's present age is 3x = 3 * 5 = 15 years.",

If the speed is increased by 10 km/h, the new speed is x + 10 km/h, and the time taken is 360/(x + 10) hours. According to the question, the difference in time is 2 hours:\n\n360/x - 360/(x + 10) = 2\n\nSolving this equation:\n\n360(x + 10) - 360x = 2x(x + 10)\n\n3600 = 2x^2 + 20x\n\nx^2 + 10x - 1800 = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation:\n\n(x + 60)(x - 30) = 0\n\nx = 30 or x = -60\n\nSince speed cannot be negative, x = 30 km/h.

Each friend owns a car of a different color: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Black. Using the clues given, determine who lives on which floor and the color of their car. 1) Alex lives on an odd-numbered floor. 2) The person with the Yellow car lives directly above Alex. 3) Bob's car is Blue and he lives on the top floor. 4) Charlie lives on a higher floor than the owner of the Black car. 5) David lives on the 3rd floor. Who owns the Red car?",

       "explanation": "Based on the clues: Bob is on the 5th floor with the Blue car. David is on the 3rd floor. Alex must be on either 1st or 3rd floor, but since David is on 3rd, Alex is on the 1st floor. Therefore, the Yellow car is on the 2nd floor. Since Charlie lives above the Black car owner and Ethan is the only one left to live on the 4th floor, the Black car must be on the 3rd floor with David. Thus, Ethan, on the 2nd floor with Yellow car, leaves Charlie with the Green car on the 4th floor, and Alex must have the Red car.",

       "explanation": "Linda on the 2nd floor implies Irene is on the 3rd floor. Monica is on the 3rd, so Monica and Irene can\u2019t share the 3rd floor. This means Irene must be on the 6th floor. Kevin must be on the 4th floor, making George on the 5th. Jessica would then be on the 7th floor since there are two floors between her and Kevin.",
