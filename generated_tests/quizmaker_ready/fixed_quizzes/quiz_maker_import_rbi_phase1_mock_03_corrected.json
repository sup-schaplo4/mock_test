      "explanation": "First, calculate services imports: $350B (exports) - $170B (surplus) = $180B. The trade balance is (Merchandise Exports - Merchandise Imports) + (Services Surplus). The current account deficit (CAD) is the negative of this balance (ignoring remittances for this calculation). So, CAD = -[(500 - Merch. Imports) + 170]. Given CAD = $54B, we have 54 = -[670 - Merch.

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation. The effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy depends on several factors, including the fiscal policy of the government and global economic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main function of the RBI as described in the passage?",

      "question": "Microfinance institutions play a crucial role in providing financial services to low-income individuals and small businesses, particularly in rural areas. These institutions offer small loans, savings accounts, and other financial products that are often inaccessible through traditional banks. While microfinance has been successful in empowering many people, it also faces challenges such as high interest rates, over-indebtedness, and regulatory oversight. Ensuring the sustainability and ethical practices of microfinance institutions is essential to maximize their positive impact and minimize potential risks.

In a 6-person circle, this means there are two people between them. Let's place A at the top (12 o'clock) and D at the bottom (6 o'clock).Use the next clue: E is sitting between B and D. This means E's immediate neighbors are B and D. Since D is at the 6 o'clock position, E and B must be on either side of D. There are two possibilities, but only one will work with the other clues. Combine with another clue: C is to the immediate left of F. This means C and F must sit together in the order C F (clockwise). Deduce the final arrangement: The only way to fit all the pieces is the following clockwise order: A, C, F, D, E, B. Check conditions: D is opposite A (✓). C is to the immediate left of F (✓). E's neighbors are D and B (✓). A is two seats away from F (✓, with C in between).",

      "question": "Five friends — A, B, C, D, E — are sitting in a row. Use the clues to find who sits in the middle (3rd seat from the left).Clues:A sits immediately to the left of C.B sits immediately to the right of C.D sits to the left of A.E sits to the right of B.D sits at an end of the row.Question: Who sits in the middle?",

      "explanation": "Explanation (step-by-step):From (1) and (2) we know A, C, B form a consecutive block with C in the middle of that block: A - C - B.That block could occupy positions (left→right) 1–3, 2–4, or 3–5. We must eliminate the possibilities that conflict with other clues.Clue (3) says D sits to the left of A. If the block were in positions 1–3 (A=1, C=2, B=3), there is no seat to the left of A, so that placement is impossible.If the block were in positions 3–5 (A=3, C=4, B=5), then (4) requires E to sit to the right of B — but B would be at the extreme right (position 5) so there is no seat to its right. Therefore that placement is impossible.The only remaining valid placement is the block in positions 2–4: A(2) - C(3) - B(4).Clue (5) requires D to be at an end and clue (3) requires D to be left of A. The only end seat left to the left of A(2) is position 1, so D must be at position 1.That leaves position 5 for E, which also satisfies clue (4) (E is to the right of B at position 4).Final left→right arrangement: D, A, C, B, E. The middle (3rd) seat is C.So the correct option is C. C.",
