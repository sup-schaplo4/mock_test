       "question": "Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks. It aims to improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial stress, improve risk management and governance, and strengthen banks' transparency and disclosures. Key elements of Basel III include higher minimum capital requirements, stricter liquidity standards, and measures to reduce procyclicality. The implementation of Basel III has been phased in over several years and has had a significant impact on the global banking landscape. While it has enhanced the stability of the banking system, it has also increased compliance costs for banks and may have contributed to a slight reduction in lending activity.\n\nWhat is the primary goal of Basel III, as described in the passage?",

       "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

These are loans where borrowers have stopped making interest or principal payments for a specified period. High levels of NPAs erode bank profitability, reduce lending capacity, and can threaten financial stability. Several factors contribute to the accumulation of NPAs, including economic slowdowns, project delays, and willful loan defaults.

       "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

       "question": "Statement: A major steel manufacturing company is facing a decline in productivity due to frequent machinery breakdowns and unskilled labor force.\n\nCourses of Action:\nI. The company should invest in regular maintenance of its machinery to prevent breakdowns.\nII. The company should organize regular training programs for its workers to enhance their skills.\nIII. The company should hire more experienced workers to replace the current workforce.",

(2) Course of Action I addresses machinery reliability, making it practical and effective. (3) Course of Action II enhances workforce skills, directly tackling the labor issue. (4) Course of Action III is impractical as retraining is more feasible than full replacement, hence doesn't follow.",

       "explanation": "This is a circular seating arrangement puzzle that you can solve step-by-step. Start with the most definite clue: W faces the center, and S is third to its left. Let's place them.V sits second to the right of S. Now, we don't know which way S is facing.Case 1: If S faces the center, V is two spots clockwise from S.Case 2: If S faces away, V is two spots counter-clockwise from S.T is an immediate neighbor of V and faces the center. This helps lock in positions.Q is not a neighbor of S, and R is second to the right of Q. This limits where Q and R can be.By testing the cases, you'll find that Case 2 becomes contradictory. In Case 1 (S faces center), the only valid arrangement that fits all conditions is (clockwise): W(in), Q(out), P(out), S(in), U(out), V(out), T(in), R(out).Let's verify the final conditions with this arrangement:Neighbors of U (S and V) face opposite directions? No, S faces in and V faces out. Correct.P and R face the same direction as V? Yes, P, R, and V all face away from the center. Correct.In the final arrangement, U is sitting to the immediate left of P (since P is facing out, left is clockwise)",

       "explanation": "This puzzle involves arranging two parallel rows based on relative positions.Let's map out the two rows of five seats.Row 1 (South): _ _ _ _ _.Row 2 (North): _ _ _ _ _.Start with Row 1: B sits third to the right of D. Since they face South, 'right' is to our left. This gives us the block D _ _ B. This block must occupy the first four or last four seats.The person facing B sits to the immediate left of R. This connects Row 1 and Row 2. Let's place the D _ _ B block at the right end of Row 1. So, D is at position 2 and B is at position 5 (extreme right).Row 1 (South): _ D _ _ B.Row 2 (North): _ _ _ R _ (The person at position 4 is to the immediate left of R).Only one person sits between R and P. With R at position 5, P must be at position 3.Row 2 (North): _ _ P R _.T sits second to the right of Q. The only remaining spots that fit this are Q at position 1 and T at position 3, but P is already there. So our initial placement of D _ _ B was wrong.Let's place D _ _ B at the left end of Row 1. So D is at pos 1 (extreme left) and B is at pos 4.Row 1 (South): D _ _ B _.Row 2 (North): _ _ R _ _ (The person facing B is at pos 4, so person at pos 3 is to the left of R). This means R is at pos 4.Now, Only one person sits between R and P means P is at pos 2. Row 2 (North): _ P _ R _.T sits second to the right of Q. Q must be at pos 1 and T at pos 3. The last person, S, is at pos 5.Row 2 (North): Q P T R S, E faces S. So E is in Row 1, position 5.Row 1 (South): D _ _ B E.A is not an immediate neighbor of D. A must go in position 3. The last person, C, goes in position 2.Row 1 (South): D C A B E.The person at the extreme left end of the South-facing row is D.",

       "explanation": "This is a standard 8-person rectangular table puzzle.Start with M. M is in the middle of a side. Let's place M in the middle of the bottom side.Only two people sit between M and L. Counting from M's left or right, L must be in the middle of the top side.P sits to the immediate left of L. L is on the top side, so its left is the top-left corner. P is at the top-left corner.J sits opposite P. P is at the top-left corner, so J is at the bottom-right corner.Q sits opposite K and O sits to the immediate right of K. The only available opposite seats are the two corners (top-right and bottom-left) and the two middle side seats (left and right). Let's test placing K. If K is at the top-right corner, Q is at the bottom-left. O would be to K's right, which is the middle of the right side. This works.N is not an immediate neighbor of J. The final empty seat is the middle of the left side. J's neighbors are the person at the bottom-left corner and the person in the middle of the right side (O). The final seat for N is not next to J. This works.The final arrangement is: L (top middle), K (top-right), O (right middle), J (bottom-right), M (bottom middle), Q (bottom-left), N (left middle), P (top-left).The person on the immediate right of M is J",
