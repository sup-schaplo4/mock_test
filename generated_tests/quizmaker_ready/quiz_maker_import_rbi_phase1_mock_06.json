These are loans where borrowers have stopped making interest or principal payments for a specified period.

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, as the central bank, plays a crucial role in managing the nation's money supply and credit. Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on several factors, including the responsiveness of businesses and consumers to interest rate changes and the overall economic outlook.\n\nWhat is the main goal of the RBI according to the passage?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

      "question": "Basel III is an international regulatory framework designed to strengthen the resilience of the banking system by enhancing capital adequacy, liquidity, and risk management. It addresses the shortcomings identified during the 2008 financial crisis. The framework introduces stricter capital requirements, including higher minimum capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer. It also establishes liquidity standards, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, to ensure that banks have sufficient liquid assets to meet short-term and long-term funding needs. Implementation of Basel III has been phased in over several years, and it continues to shape banking regulations globally.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is the purpose of Basel III?",

      "question": "The concept of moral suasion is often employed by central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India, as a tool to influence the behavior of commercial banks. It involves the central bank using persuasive techniques, rather than formal regulations, to encourage banks to comply with its policy objectives. This might include public statements, private meetings, or informal guidance. Moral suasion is most effective when the central bank has a strong reputation and a good relationship with the commercial banks. However, its effectiveness can be limited if banks have conflicting incentives or if the central bank lacks credibility. It is a subtle tool and its impact is often difficult to quantify.\n\nWhat is the central idea behind the use of moral suasion by central banks?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation. The effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy depends on several factors, including the fiscal policy of the government and global economic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main function of the RBI as described in the passage?",

Each has a different hobby (Gardening, Painting, Cycling, Cooking, Reading, Writing, Dancing, Hiking, and Photography) and a different favorite animal (Dog, Cat, Bird, Fish, Rabbit, Hamster, Turtle, Horse, and Snake). The following clues are given: 1. Harry lives two floors above the person who likes Painting. 2. The person who likes Photography lives on the top floor. 3. Ian's favorite animal is a Rabbit and he lives below the fifth floor. 4. The person who enjoys Cooking lives immediately above Mike, whose favorite animal is a Cat. 5. The person who likes Gardening has a Hamster and lives on the third floor. 6. Jack lives between the person who likes Cycling and the person who likes Hiking. 7. Kate enjoys Dancing and her favorite animal is a Dog. 8. Linda lives on the floor just above the person who likes Reading. 9. Nancy's favorite animal is a Turtle and she lives three floors below the Photography enthusiast. 10. Oscar, who lives on an even-numbered floor, likes Writing. 11.

Cooking is above Mike, 3 becomes Gardening, so Mike is 2 or 1, but due to Ian, 2. 5. 6-7 with Harry, Painting comes below, probably 5, and thus Jack needs between Cycling and Hiking. 6.

      "explanation": "The pattern involves shifting each letter forward by 1 and replacing the vowels with their position number in the word. For example, RAINBOW becomes S5JMMBY: R+1=S, A is 5th in the alphabet and a vowel so 5, I+1=J, N+1=M, B+1=C but encoded as M for consistency, O+1=P but encoded as B for consistency, W+1=X but encoded as Y for consistency. For SUNSHINE: T8VOIFMF follows similar rules. MOONLIGHT: N9PLMHSI where M+1=N, O is 9th vowel, etc.",
