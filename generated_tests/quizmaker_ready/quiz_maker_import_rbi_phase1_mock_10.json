      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation.

Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates.

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

      "question": "The global financial crisis of 2008 highlighted the interconnectedness of financial markets and the importance of robust risk management practices. The crisis originated in the United States with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and quickly spread to other countries, causing widespread economic disruption. Banks experienced significant losses, credit markets froze, and many businesses faced bankruptcy. Governments and central banks intervened with massive bailouts and monetary easing measures to stabilize the financial system. The crisis led to increased regulation of the financial industry and a greater focus on preventing future crises. International cooperation is essential for addressing systemic risks and promoting global financial stability.\n\nWhat was a key factor that contributed to the global financial crisis of 2008?",

      "question_image": null,
      "type": "radio",
      "category": "Reasoning",
      "explanation": "The pattern involves shifting each letter forward by 1 and replacing the vowels with their position number in the word. For example, RAINBOW becomes S5JMMBY: R+1=S, A is 5th in the alphabet and a vowel so 5, I+1=J, N+1=M, B+1=C but encoded as M for consistency, O+1=P but encoded as B for consistency, W+1=X but encoded as Y for consistency. For SUNSHINE: T8VOIFMF follows similar rules. MOONLIGHT: N9PLMHSI where M+1=N, O is 9th vowel, etc.",

      "question": "Statement: An experiment conducted on nocturnal animals showed that a decrease in night light intensity by 30% resulted in increased foraging activity. However, the study also noted an increase in predation risks for these animals under reduced lighting.\n\nWhich of the following inference(s) can be definitely drawn from the above statement?\n\nI. Nocturnal animals forage more when it is darker.\nII. Reduced lighting always increases predation risks for nocturnal animals.\nIII. Increased foraging activity in low light is linked with higher predation risks.",

      "explanation": "Analysis: (1) Key points are increased foraging with reduced light and linked predation risks. (2) Evaluation: I is valid as increased foraging was observed with reduced light. II is invalid because the statement doesn't claim 'always', only observed increased risk in this study. III is valid as the study notes an increase in predation risks associated with increased foraging under reduced light conditions. (3) Inferences I and III are valid.",
