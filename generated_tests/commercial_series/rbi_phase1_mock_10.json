          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, as the central bank, plays a crucial role in managing the nation's money supply and credit. Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on several factors, including the responsiveness of businesses and consumers to interest rate changes and the overall economic outlook.\n\nWhat is the main goal of the RBI according to the passage?",

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",
