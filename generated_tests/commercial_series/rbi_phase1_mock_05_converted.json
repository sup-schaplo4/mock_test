Key elements of Basel III include higher minimum capital requirements, stricter liquidity standards, and measures to reduce procyclicality.

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

          "question": "Economic indicators provide valuable insights into the health and performance of an economy. Key indicators include gross domestic product, GDP, inflation rate, unemployment rate, and interest rates. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. A high GDP growth rate indicates a strong and expanding economy. The inflation rate measures the rate at which prices are rising. High inflation can erode purchasing power and destabilize the economy. The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. High unemployment can lead to social and economic problems. Central banks use these indicators to make informed decisions about monetary policy.\n\nAccording to the passage, what does a high GDP growth rate indicate?",

It involves the central bank using persuasive techniques, rather than formal regulations, to encourage banks to comply with its policy objectives. This might include public statements, private meetings, or informal guidance. Moral suasion is most effective when the central bank has a strong reputation and a good relationship with the commercial banks. However, its effectiveness can be limited if banks have conflicting incentives or if the central bank lacks credibility.

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

E sits between A and B; hence A, E, B are fixed. From condition 2, D is placed with elderberry. C at the extreme end leaves only one position for F, and checking conditions ensures placement.
