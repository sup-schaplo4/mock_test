          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates.

The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity.

It addresses the shortcomings identified during the 2008 financial crisis. The framework introduces stricter capital requirements, including higher minimum capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer. It also establishes liquidity standards, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, to ensure that banks have sufficient liquid assets to meet short-term and long-term funding needs. Implementation of Basel III has been phased in over several years, and it continues to shape banking regulations globally.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is the purpose of Basel III?",

They contain items with two attributes: color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black, White, Pink) and weight (Light, Heavy). Conditions: 1) The Red box is somewhere to the left of the Blue box and is Light. 2) The Yellow box is Heavy and immediately next to the Pink box. 3) The White box is third from the right. 4) The Green box is heavier than the Red box and is somewhere to the left of the Black box. 5) The Pink box is at one end and is Light.

(2) Statement II alone provides the length of the other leg, but again without more information, it is insufficient. (3) Together, knowing both legs (5 and 12), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to check the validity of the triangle's hypotenuse c or calculate the area directly as (1/2)*5*12.

D sits to the immediate left of C, and D faces away from the center. \n4. E sits second to the right of D. \n5. F sits opposite to E. \n6. G is not an immediate neighbor of B.\n7. H sits to the immediate right of A. Both G and H face the same direction.\n\nLet's deduce:\nSince B faces the center and A is third to the right, we can place A and B. With two people between B and C, we can place C. D is to the immediate left of C and faces away from the center. E is second to the right of D, and F is opposite to E. G cannot be next to B, and H is to the immediate right of A. Since G and H face the same direction, and we know the directions of other people, we can determine their directions. Final Arrangement (assuming clockwise order and starting with B):\nB(center) - _ - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H/G.\nKnowing all placements from above, H must be next to A and G cannot be next to B. Hence, the final arrangement is B(center) - G - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H. This means that the arrangement is: B(center) - G(away) - C(center) - D(away) - A(center) - H(center) - F(away) - E(center).\n\nTherefore, A is second to the left of E.",
