          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates.

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation. The effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy depends on several factors, including the fiscal policy of the government and global economic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main function of the RBI as described in the passage?",

Arranging according to weight: Q, T, R can be placed as 1, 2, 3. Thus, the order from left to right is: Q, T, R, S, U, V, P. Therefore, Box T is at the third position.",

Final Arrangement (assuming clockwise order and starting with B):\nB(center) - _ - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H/G.\nKnowing all placements from above, H must be next to A and G cannot be next to B. Hence, the final arrangement is B(center) - G - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H. This means that the arrangement is: B(center) - G(away) - C(center) - D(away) - A(center) - H(center) - F(away) - E(center).\n\nTherefore, A is second to the left of E.",
