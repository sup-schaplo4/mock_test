          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation.

          "explanation": "In part (C), the verb phrase 'has been persisted' is grammatically incorrect. The verb 'persist' is typically intransitive, meaning it does not take a direct object and cannot usually be used in the passive voice. Volatility itself 'persists' or 'has persisted'. The correct active voice present perfect form should be used here. Thus, 'has been persisted' should be 'has persisted'. The corrected sentence would be: 'Despite the sustained efforts by the RBI to stabilize the currency in recent months, the market volatility has persisted due to external economic pressures.'",

Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates.

It addresses the shortcomings identified during the 2008 financial crisis. The framework introduces stricter capital requirements, including higher minimum capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer. It also establishes liquidity standards, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, to ensure that banks have sufficient liquid assets to meet short-term and long-term funding needs. Implementation of Basel III has been phased in over several years, and it continues to shape banking regulations globally.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is the purpose of Basel III?",

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

          "question": "Five friends named Alex, Bob, Charlie, David, and Ethan each live on a different floor of a five-story building. The floors are numbered 1 to 5, with 5 being the top floor. Each friend owns a car of a different color: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Black. Using the clues given, determine who lives on which floor and the color of their car. 1) Alex lives on an odd-numbered floor. 2) The person with the Yellow car lives directly above Alex. 3) Bob's car is Blue and he lives on the top floor. 4) Charlie lives on a higher floor than the owner of the Black car. 5) David lives on the 3rd floor. Who owns the Red car?",

            "E": "Ethan"
          },
          "correct_answer": "E",
          "explanation": "Based on the clues: Bob is on the 5th floor with the Blue car. David is on the 3rd floor. Alex must be on either 1st or 3rd floor, but since David is on 3rd, Alex is on the 1st floor. Therefore, the Yellow car is on the 2nd floor. Since Charlie lives above the Black car owner and Ethan is the only one left to live on the 4th floor, the Black car must be on the 3rd floor with David. Thus, Ethan, on the 2nd floor with Yellow car, leaves Charlie with the Green car on the 4th floor, and Alex must have the Red car.",
