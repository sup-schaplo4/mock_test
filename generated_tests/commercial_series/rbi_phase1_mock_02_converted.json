The current account deficit (CAD) is the negative of this balance (ignoring remittances for this calculation). So, CAD = -[(500 - Merch. Imports) + 170]. Given CAD = $54B, we have 54 = -[670 - Merch. Imports]. -54 = Merch. Imports - 670. Merch. Imports = 670 - 54 = $616 billion. The source document separately states merchandise imports at $720 billion and trade deficit at $220 billion, with CAD at 1.2% ($54B), indicating remittances and other factors played a role. However, based on the trade data provided ($500B export, $720B import), the merchandise trade deficit is $220B.  With a services surplus of $170B, the combined goods and services deficit is $50B, which aligns closely with the stated CAD of $54B.",

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.\n\nWhat is the most likely consequence of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",

            "A": "Increased economic growth",

It addresses the shortcomings identified during the 2008 financial crisis. The framework introduces stricter capital requirements, including higher minimum capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer. It also establishes liquidity standards, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, to ensure that banks have sufficient liquid assets to meet short-term and long-term funding needs.
