The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted.

Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates.

The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument.

          "question": "Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks. It aims to improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial stress, improve risk management and governance, and strengthen banks' transparency and disclosures. Key elements of Basel III include higher minimum capital requirements, stricter liquidity standards, and measures to reduce procyclicality. The implementation of Basel III has been phased in over several years and has had a significant impact on the global banking landscape. While it has enhanced the stability of the banking system, it has also increased compliance costs for banks and may have contributed to a slight reduction in lending activity.\n\nWhat is the primary goal of Basel III, as described in the passage?",

It also establishes liquidity standards, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, to ensure that banks have sufficient liquid assets to meet short-term and long-term funding needs.

The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation. The effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy depends on several factors, including the fiscal policy of the government and global economic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main function of the RBI as described in the passage?",

The following clues are given: 1. Harry lives two floors above the person who likes Painting. 2. The person who likes Photography lives on the top floor. 3. Ian's favorite animal is a Rabbit and he lives below the fifth floor. 4. The person who enjoys Cooking lives immediately above Mike, whose favorite animal is a Cat. 5. The person who likes Gardening has a Hamster and lives on the third floor. 6. Jack lives between the person who likes Cycling and the person who likes Hiking. 7. Kate enjoys Dancing and her favorite animal is a Dog. 8. Linda lives on the floor just above the person who likes Reading. 9. Nancy's favorite animal is a Turtle and she lives three floors below the Photography enthusiast. 10. Oscar, who lives on an even-numbered floor, likes Writing. 11. Paula's favorite animal is a Fish, and she does not live on the top floor. Who lives on the second floor and what are their hobby and favorite animal?",

Ian and Rabbit must be below 5, so 1-4 range, but not 3 which is Gardening. 4. Cooking is above Mike, 3 becomes Gardening, so Mike is 2 or 1, but due to Ian, 2. 5. 6-7 with Harry, Painting comes below, probably 5, and thus Jack needs between Cycling and Hiking. 6. Kate's Dog means she could be in early floors due to the 2 gap. 7. Linda is above Reading. 8. Nancy below Photography by 3 and enjoys Turtle. 9. Oscar on even with Writing, making it 4/6/8. 10. Paula with Fish not on 9. Hence, Mike is on 2 with Cycling and Cat due to combinations with constraints.",
