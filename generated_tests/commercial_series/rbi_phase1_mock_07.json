These reforms include deregulation of interest rates, reduction in statutory reserve requirements, and the introduction of stricter prudential norms.

Furthermore, the government has taken steps to consolidate public sector banks to enhance their operational efficiency and financial strength. However, challenges remain, including the need to further improve asset quality, strengthen risk management practices, and adapt to the evolving landscape of digital banking.

The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation. The effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy depends on several factors, including the fiscal policy of the government and global economic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main function of the RBI as described in the passage?",

The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted.

          "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

          "question": "Basel III is an international regulatory framework designed to strengthen the resilience of the banking system by enhancing capital adequacy, liquidity, and risk management. It addresses the shortcomings identified during the 2008 financial crisis. The framework introduces stricter capital requirements, including higher minimum capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer. It also establishes liquidity standards, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio, to ensure that banks have sufficient liquid assets to meet short-term and long-term funding needs. Implementation of Basel III has been phased in over several years, and it continues to shape banking regulations globally.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is the purpose of Basel III?",

Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates.

By clue 2, arrange box 3 two spaces right from green, bottom shelf. Box 7's positioning between yellow and orange comes from clue 4, aligned with clue 5 placing purple on top. Black and red get placement per clues 3 and 6, Box 10's higher rating fixes its relative position. Sequential placement of other boxes confirms yellow as bottom shelf, third from the right.",

The placement goes W, Z, X, D1, leaving the other row positions available for adjustments.\nGiven W is left of Y (Condition 2) and U is opposite V (Condition 1), U and V fill additional spaces in their rows. Due to B1 not opposing Y, B1 takes the last spot.\nThe complete arrangement reveals D1 opposite X. Arrangement: Row 1: U-Y-W-Z-X, Row 2: V-B1-D1-A1-C1, confirming D1 is opposite X.",
