Q.166) Ans: (A)
EXP: The distance between point E and K is 9m. Hence, the distance between B and K is 9 – 5= 4m.

Q.167) Ans: (D)
EXP: Hence, from point M 3m towards north, turn right and walk for 4m leads to point A.

Q.168) Ans: (C)
EXP: Hence, point C is in east direction with respect to point P.

Q.169) Ans: (B)
EXP: Hence, Arun walks 11m to reach point D.

Q.170) Ans: (D)
EXP: Statement A states the tourism package offered by various travel agencies of country G. Statement C states that the country G have started special buses, trains and flights at reasonable rates for passengers. Statement C states that city F in country G lower their holiday packages for tourists. Statement D states that country G was most preferred tourist destination from the last three years.

Q.171) Ans: (A)
EXP: The whole passage is about how during the time of recession, the Greek government has imposed huge business taxes on the companies, thus making them flee the country. So, option A is correct. Option B is incorrect as many companies have migrated owing to the prevalent economic situations. Option C is incorrect as the fourth paragraph mentions “Other euro-crisis countries, such as Portugal and Ireland...” D is not at all mentioned in the passage.

Q.172) Ans: (C)
EXP: The whole passage is about how during the time of recession, the Greek government has imposed huge business taxes on the companies, thus making them flee the country, which therefore, has hampered the economy. Hence option C is the best fit answer.

Q.173) Ans: (D)
EXP: IV is incorrect with reference to the passage. It states quite the opposite of what is given. Investment and growth cannot be promoted by levying huge amount of taxes. The other three statements are true in the context of the passage. Thus, option D is the correct answer.

Q.174) Ans: (C)
EXP: In the last line of the passage, the author states “Carry on in this vein, and there will not be many businesses, or much profit, left to tax.” This means that he/ she believes that if the imposition of business tax continues, Greece will not be left with many businesses. Thus, option C is the correct answer.

Q.175) Ans: (A)
EXP: Since the companies are leaving Greece under the threat of imposition of huge taxes, it can be said that Greece is no more business friendly and also that the taxes are unjustified. Thus, option A is the correct answer. B is not stated in the passage and C is also incorrect as we are not told whether Bulgaria has not been affected by the European crises. D is completely wrong, and E does not state the correct reason for the departure of the companies. Rather than the recession, it is the high taxes that caused them to flee.

Q.176) Ans: (B)
EXP: The idiom “grasping at straws” is used when you’re desperate and pursuing even the slightest hope or possibility(even if it probably won’t work). This meaning is accurately conveyed in option B which indicates that the detective was trying hard to find a clue even though practically there was none. Option A uses the phrase incorrectly, and “beating around the bush” would fit more appropriately than “grasping at straws”. Option C mentions grasping at straws as a regular activity which is incorrect. Option D more or less indicates the literal meaning of the phrase. Hence, option B is the correct answer.

Q.177) Ans: (D)
EXP: If someone is left holding the baby, they are made responsible for a problem that others don't want to deal with. This meaning is appropriately conveyed by option D as the senior let the speaker suffer alone. Option A conveys that Aryan tricks you. Option B conveys that work was left on somebody else. Option C conveys a literal sense of holding a baby. Thus, option D is the best fit answer.

Q.178) Ans: (A)
EXP: The idiom “to play by ears” means to decide how to deal with a situation as it develops, rather than acting according to plans made ear lier. Since option A talks about unpredictability, the idiom best fits in the context. Options A and D talk about music and C talks about it as a habit that can land someone into jail.

Q.179) Ans: (B)
EXP: Note that the blank space is followed by the word out, with which “get” forms a phrasal verb, but without lending the sentence the required meaning. To get out means to leave, but with respect to the context, things are being found out about the civilization.(I) cannot follow as the phrase “internalizing out” is incorrect.(III) fits in appropriately and option B is the correct answer.

Q.180) Ans: (E)
EXP: The part after the comma in the given sentence means that many people want her to run for the fifth term. Hence the part in the blank may state that “she” answered the questions or avoided them. Thus, all I, II and III fit in the blank and convey meaningful and grammatically correct meaning.

Q.181) Ans: (D)
EXP: People cannot be suspected to take ownership of the public facilities; hence the word is incorrect in the context of the given sentence. Here the “it” must have requested the residents, hence “requested” or “urged” would be a correct term. Procure means to secure and the facilities can be secured by tax revenuse paid by members of the public. The usage of the word “against” towards the end clearly indicates that a negative word must be used after it as you would secure something against a bad thing, So, vandalism, which means the deliberate destruction of or damage to public or private property, is the correct answer.

Q.182) Ans: (A)
EXP: Sycophancy: praising people in authority in a way that is not sincere, usually in order to get some advantage from them Pluralism: a condition or system in which two or more states, groups, principles, sources of authority, etc., coexist. Exaggerated: represent (something) as being larger, better, or worse than it really is It is very unlikely that those who are sycophants would be attacked, hence, “dissent” or disagreement would be a more proper word. One cannot say that any rule of the Constitution is exaggerated. Freedom of speech and expression is one of the basic or ground rules of the Constitution. “Pluralism” is correct in the given context. Hence option A is the correct answer.

Q.183) Ans: (D)
EXP: Ostracise- exclude from a society or group. Hoodlums- a person who engages in crime and violence; a hooligan or gangster Facilitate- provide One cannot be ostracised “with”, hence the first word is incorrect. “Sympathised would be more appropriate in the given context. With reference to destruction, “hoodlums’ is correct and facilitated also fits appropriately in the context.

Q.184) Ans: (E)
EXP: Harangue- a lengthy and aggressive speech Lay out- express Obstruct- hinder Since the context talks about a person criticizing the Supreme Court, all the words fit appropriately.

Q.185) Ans: (B)
EXP: Accost-approach and address (someone) boldly or aggressively Canonize-(in the Roman Catholic Church) officially declare(a dead person) to be a saint. Emollient- having the quality of softening or soothing the skin Accost is a verb, but we need a noun as the word is followed by the preposition “of”. Hence, in the given context a word like “legend” would be more appropriate. Canonized fits well with the context of the Church of Rome. Again, “emollient” is an adjective, but we require a verb to show what the new cult would do to the memory of Hus. Thus, words synonymous as well as opposite in meaning to “strengthen” can be used. Option B is the correct answer.

Q.186) Ans: (D)
EXP: Cavort- skip dance Acquiesce-accept something reluctantly but without protest Cantankerous- bad- tempered Catechize- put questions to or interrogate(someone). Rapacious-greedy Resuscitate- revive(someone) from unconsciousness or apparent death Obliterate- destroy Humongous- huge Abscond- escape For the first blank we need an adjective for the word “leader”. Hence, option A can be eliminated as “cavort” is a verb. Humongous is also not an apt adjective for a leader in the given contexts. This eliminates option E. The tone of the second sentence seems to be positive with respect to the leader, hence B and C can be eliminated. The words in option D properly fit in the blanks, thus, it is the correct answer.

Q.187) Ans: (C)
EXP: Dearth-shortage Cogent- convincing Debauchery- excessive indulgence in sex, alcohol, or drugs Congruity- the quality of agreeing; being suitable and appropriate Cleave- split or sever(something) Parlance- a particular way of speaking or using words, especially a way common to those with a particular job or interest Diminution- restriction, limitation The usage “between” after the first blank in the second sentence suggests that “congruity” is the most appropriate fit as it there can be agreement between two entities. Even in the first sentence, two things have been mentioned. “Perspective” fits well after “individual’s”. Thus, option C is the correct answer.

Q.188) Ans: (A)
EXP: Monumental- great in importance, extent, or size Exaggeration-statement that represents something as better or worse than it really is Debunk- explode Emulation-to copy something achieved by someone else Espouse- adopt Doomsday- the last day of the world's existence Expunge- erase Fallacies- misconception Hegemony- dominance The first blank of the second sentence undoubtedly requires an adjective to modify the noun reforms. Only “monumental” is an adjective among all the given words for the first blank. Hence, option A is the best fit answer.

Q.189) Ans: (B)
EXP: “Because” shows a reason, but since the second sentence does not state a reason behind the second, alternative I can be eliminated. III is an unfit as “between” must take two entities which is not mentioned in the first sentence. Alternative II fits appropriately as the first sentence gives a reason why it became a difficult task for her and “however” acts as “but” to show the contrast. New statement: This became a difficult task, as her publishers in Philadelphia had retired from business many years ago; however, it was eventually discovered that her residence is at Wilmington, Delaware, and copies of the second edition of the book, 1889, were obtained from her.

Q.190) Ans: (C)
EXP: “Hadly... but” is an incorrect pair of correlative conjunctions, hence, I can be discarded. Here “since wou’ld mean “because”, which would be inept to join the two sentences. “During” shows the duration of time and “which” follows logically. New Statement: During the first nineteen months of my life I had caught glimpses of broad, green fields, a luminous sky, trees and flowers which the darkness that followed could not wholly blot out.

Q.191) Ans: (D)
EXP: In the first parts several phrases have been connected by commas, so another phrase can be added to it. Also, since the second part expresses a contrast to the first, “but” is suitable for it. Hence, both I and III can join the two sentences appropriately. “So” indicates a reason, which is not the case. Option D is the correct answer. New statement: He redressed many grievances, regulated the administration of justice, encouraged commerce, reformed the coinage, but as time went on he was compelled to demand larger subsidies and to take severer measures against heretical opinions.

Q.192) Ans: (B)
EXP: Only option B carries a correct statement. The errors in the other parts are as follows: A-Increase is a noun, hence the adjective “substantial” should be used instead of the adverb “substantially”. C- “Database” is a collective noun, and in the given context, a singular verb should be used with it. So, “show” should be replace by “shows”. D- “They” in the latter part of the sentence is incorrect as the subject here is singular “he” and n other entity is being talked about here. E- The phrase “once belongs” is incorrect. It should be once belonged.

Q.193) Ans: (A)
EXP: Only sentence A is correct. The errors in the other options are as follows: B-“Lack of privacy” is the correct phrase and not “lacking od privacy” C-The usage of the article “the” indicates superlative degree, hence, “more” should be replaced by “most”. D-“Infant” and “maternal” acts as adjectives, hence the noun “mortality” should be used. E-“Construction- work” is a singular term, hence, “are” should be replaced by “is”.

Q.194) Ans: (C)
EXP: Only C is the correct statement. The errors in the other options are as follows: A- Here the usage of the word “British’s” is incorrect. British itself is an adjective and hence the possessive need not be used. The phrase “British economy” conveys the required meaning. B- The usage of “to entering” is incorrect. Since “entering” shows movement, the preposition “into” should be used. D- “Not only” and “but also” form a corelative conjunction, thus the usage of “but so” is wrong. E- The phrase “to generation” is wrong. With “to” the base form of the verb should be used to form an infinitive. Thus, “to generate” is the correct phrase.

Q.195) Ans: (D)
EXP: Only option D is error free. The errors in the other parts are as follows: A-“Participation of patients” is correct, thus, for should be replaced by “for”. B- The phrase “rise and reign” acts as a singular entity, thus the singular verb “is” should be used with it. C-The phrase “called in” is incorrect, as it means to make a call to someone. Here the context is about people asking the university and government to do more to prevent sexual assault and harassment. Thus, the phrase “called on” should be used which means to ask someone to do something.

Q.196) Ans: (B)
EXP: According to the first paragraph of the passage, “U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem irreparably damaged the United States’ image as a credible arbiter in the Israel-Palestine conflict.” Hence option B states the correct answer.

Q.197) Ans: (A)
EXP: According to the passage, “Its “friend-to-all” image enabled New Delhi to garner an invitation from Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas to sit on a proposed “multilateral forum” for negotiations on a peace deal between Palestine and Israel—a role India is increasingly able to fill.” This means that India is a country which does not take sides, rather it is diplomatic in its approach. Hence it is admired by all the nations as an arbitrator. So, option A is the correct answer.

Q.198) Ans: (B)
EXP: The passage represents India as a country which des not arbitrarily favour any country but tries to have diplomatic relationship with all. So, it is neutral in its approach. Thus, option B is the correct answer.

Q.199) Ans: (E)
EXP: All the statements are true with reference to the given passage, thus, E is the correct answer.

Q.200) Ans: (B)
EXP: In the given passages the author discusses the neutral role played by India at the global platform. He/ she analyses the position of India with reference to several countries by putting forth arguments and examples. Tus, option B best describes the tone of the passage. The passage is not objective as the author does not report events. It is also not critical as it does not criticize any entity but analyses the facts. Acerbic- harsh Sarcastic- humorous
