Option B and E can be easily eliminated as they would not convey a sound grammatical meaning. “Unique” is incorrect as the latter part of the sentence talks about challenges, and it is quite sarcastic to say that unique economies would pose challenges. Since the tone of the passage is not sarcastic, “unique” can be eliminates. Option C seems to fit in the blank but a phrase like “reshaping economies” is less appropriate than the phrase like “emerging economies”. Emerging economies refer to the developing economies, or those which are towards the betterment. Hence, option A would be the most appropriate response.",

      "text": "Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions. Certain words are printed in bold to help you locate them while answering some of the questions. In the public's eye, military men are still the sole sufferers of PTSD. But research shows that women are in some cases twice as likely to develop the disorder. Despite being far more vulnerable, women are often misdiagnosed due to cultural stereotypes, and there's a huge gap in research on which kinds of treatments work best for which kinds of people. Studies and research programs have been designed, until recently, to understand men with PTSD. The same is true for support systems and treatment centers. In the legal system, women who report PTSD from rape are less likely to be believed than men who report PTSD from combat. Research shows that women are at a higher risk of PTSD. While men experience more traumatic events in their lives, women are, depending on which study you look at, as much as twice as likely to develop PTSD, but no one really knows why. Pervasive male prejudice against women is another factor that can diminish unit cohesion for female soldiers. Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD. For women, this hesitation to self-identify as a sufferer of PTSD could be even greater; historically, female soldiers have struggled to be counted as equals to men on the battlefield. Women, stereotypically considered to possess less emotional fortitude than men, may be unwilling to admit that they are suffering from PTSD lest they appear to conform to this stereotype. That domestic bit has another face too: Where men who've experienced trauma might be able to take time off to recover, women are expected to maintain their domestic, caregiving roles, which make it harder for women to address symptoms of post-traumatic stress for fear of \"failing\" at their roles as mother, daughter and wife. \"Gendered social roles can compound the negative impact,\" said Dawne Vogt, a research psychologist at the Women's Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD. \"So they might have additional stress when they're dealing with something. \"Technically, PTSD is largely the same for men and women, characterized by things like fear based anxiety, sleep disturbance, flashbacks, feelings of detachment and more. And both men and women often experience multiple conditions alongside PTSD. But they seem to develop different sets of additional problems. Women tend to develop depression alongside their PTSD, while men tend to tack on substance abuse. What that means is that men with PTSD tend to show a different profile than women do. Men tend to lash out, showing anger, hostility, explosiveness and unpredictability. Women, often because of their depression, tend to do the opposite, becoming withdrawn and turning to self harm. What is clear is that women who return from combat, with PTSD or not, often have a harder time returning to their lives. According to a report by the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Labor and Housing and Urban Development, \"America's nearly 300,000 women veterans are put at risk by a system designed for and dominated by male veterans.\" This includes lack of access to peer support, group therapy and specialized mental health care for things like PTSD. Recent changes made by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have improved treatment options for female veterans living with PTSD, but there is still more that needs to be done. Women veterans are also more likely to be unemployed than male veterans, and at least twice as likely to be homeless. On top of that, women veterans are more likely to be single parents and come back to dependents. But Vogt says that nobody knows how this might impact their PTSD, or which treatments might work best. And it's not necessarily clear that what works for veterans will work for civilians either. Right now, for example, most of the research on virtual reality uses for treating PTSD focuses on military men.Another challenge is that until very recently, treatment for PTSD has been more difficult for women than men to obtain. Before rule changes were enacted in 2010, only veterans who encountered direct combat experience qualified to receive disability payments for PTSD. Because very few women are placed on the front lines, very few were eligible to receive free treatment for PTSD. However, recent regulation changes have ended these stipulations, allowing women who serve in any capacity to be eligible for benefits. Even if female veterans are eligible for these benefits, the quality of the care a wartime PTSD sufferer receives can vary widely. The United States Department of Veterans Affair(VA) pays disability benefits to service men and women who have been diagnosed with PTSD and also provides these individuals with free health care. But while mental health counseling that comes directly from VA doctors is completely free to veterans, there are often long waiting lists for those who need to be evaluated or treated. Therapy provided by non-VA professionals may not be covered by health insurance. Access to mental health professionals who have been specially trained to treat wartime PTSD is often difficult for those not living near major urban centers. On both the research level and the policy level, more must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country Figuring out which treatment works best for PTSD is still an ongoing process for everybody, men and women alike. But if researchers want to help treat people equally, they'll need to include more women. What is the style of the passage?",

Narrative writing's main purpose is to tell a story. The author will create different characters and tell you what happens to them(sometimes the author writes from the point of view of one of the characters Persuasive writing's main purpose is to convince. Unlike expository writing, persuasive writing contains the opinions and biases of the author. An argument paragraph presents a point of view and provides evidence for the point of view taken.

Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD. For women, this hesitation to self-identify as a sufferer of PTSD could be even greater; historically, female soldiers have struggled to be counted as equals to men on the battlefield. Women, stereotypically considered to possess less emotional fortitude than men, may be unwilling to admit that they are suffering from PTSD lest they appear to conform to this stereotype. That domestic bit has another face too: Where men who've experienced trauma might be able to take time off to recover, women are expected to maintain their domestic, caregiving roles, which make it harder for women to address symptoms of post-traumatic stress for fear of \"failing\" at their roles as mother, daughter and wife. \"Gendered social roles can compound the negative impact,\" said Dawne Vogt, a research psychologist at the Women's Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD. \"So they might have additional stress when they're dealing with something. \"Technically, PTSD is largely the same for men and women, characterized by things like fear based anxiety, sleep disturbance, flashbacks, feelings of detachment and more. And both men and women often experience multiple conditions alongside PTSD. But they seem to develop different sets of additional problems. Women tend to develop depression alongside their PTSD, while men tend to tack on substance abuse. What that means is that men with PTSD tend to show a different profile than women do. Men tend to lash out, showing anger, hostility, explosiveness and unpredictability. Women, often because of their depression, tend to do the opposite, becoming withdrawn and turning to self harm. What is clear is that women who return from combat, with PTSD or not, often have a harder time returning to their lives. According to a report by the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Labor and Housing and Urban Development, \"America's nearly 300,000 women veterans are put at risk by a system designed for and dominated by male veterans.\" This includes lack of access to peer support, group therapy and specialized mental health care for things like PTSD. Recent changes made by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have improved treatment options for female veterans living with PTSD, but there is still more that needs to be done. Women veterans are also more likely to be unemployed than male veterans, and at least twice as likely to be homeless. On top of that, women veterans are more likely to be single parents and come back to dependents. But Vogt says that nobody knows how this might impact their PTSD, or which treatments might work best. And it's not necessarily clear that what works for veterans will work for civilians either. Right now, for example, most of the research on virtual reality uses for treating PTSD focuses on military men.Another challenge is that until very recently, treatment for PTSD has been more difficult for women than men to obtain. Before rule changes were enacted in 2010, only veterans who encountered direct combat experience qualified to receive disability payments for PTSD. Because very few women are placed on the front lines, very few were eligible to receive free treatment for PTSD. However, recent regulation changes have ended these stipulations, allowing women who serve in any capacity to be eligible for benefits. Even if female veterans are eligible for these benefits, the quality of the care a wartime PTSD sufferer receives can vary widely. The United States Department of Veterans Affair(VA) pays disability benefits to service men and women who have been diagnosed with PTSD and also provides these individuals with free health care. But while mental health counseling that comes directly from VA doctors is completely free to veterans, there are often long waiting lists for those who need to be evaluated or treated. Therapy provided by non-VA professionals may not be covered by health insurance. Access to mental health professionals who have been specially trained to treat wartime PTSD is often difficult for those not living near major urban centers. On both the research level and the policy level, more must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country Figuring out which treatment works best for PTSD is still an ongoing process for everybody, men and women alike. But if researchers want to help treat people equally, they'll need to include more women. Based on information in the passage, it can be inferred that negative stereotypes about women in the military contribute to their increased likelihood to develop PTSD in which of the following ways? I. Some male members of the armed forces subscribe to negative stereotypes about women; this prejudice may prevent women from forming close bonds with their units. II. Women may be less likely than men to admit to suffering from PTSD because they do not want to conform to stereotypes that portray women as weak. III. Women are aware of the negative stereotypes that pervade the military. This awareness may lead to a reduction in self-esteem. (a) Only I (b) Only II (c) Both I and II (d) Both II and III (e) None of these",

Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD.” This means that male prejudice against women may limit unit cohesion for women and prevent them from forming close bonds with their units. Low unit cohesion is cited as a factor that may lead to increased risk of PTSD. This supports option(I). The author states that “for women, this hesitation to self-identify as a sufferer of PTSD could be even greater. This means that some women hesitate to admit they are suffering from PTSD because they do not want to conform to stereotypes that portray women as weak. This supports option(II). Although it might be true that women’s awareness of negative stereotypes may lead to a reduction in self-esteem, this not discussed in the passage. Furthermore, a reduction in self-esteem is cited as a result of PTSD, not a factor that increases the likelihood of developing PTSD. This eliminates option(III). Therefore(C) is correct.",

        "E": "The amount of care provided has improved over the past few years, but it is still insufficient"

      "correct_answer": "E",
      "explanation": "In passage, author states that due to “recent changes,” there are now “improved treatment options” for female veterans suffering from PTSD. The author also discusses a rule change that now makes mental health counseling available to women who have not served in combat positions, which increases women’s eligibility for benefits. Despite these improvements, the author suggests in the final paragraph that the amount of care provided is still insufficient by stating, “More must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country.” Based on this information, we can determine that the author believes the amount of care provided has improved over the past few years, but it is still insufficient. Therefore(E) is correct. The author does not suggest that state and independent agencies have made up for government deficiencies, so(A) is incorrect. Although the author is critical of the government, he or she is not so harsh as to suggest that the government has done almost nothing to help. This makes(B) incorrect. The author claims that mental health care has been worse for female veterans as compared to males, not better, so(C) is incorrect. The author goes on to explain that women may be even more hesitant to ask for help than men because of negative gender stereotypes.

      "text": "It is believed that algae grows faster in slow-flowing water. On the other hand, it is also argued that growth of algae causes hindrance to the flow of water. As more algae grows the speed at which water flows decreases. Which of the following, if true, would most appropriately weaken the argument that growth of algae reduces speed of water?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Algae grows at the same rate in still water as the rate at which it grows in flowing water.",

Choice(A) talks about growth of algae but does not indicate anything about the change in the speed of flow after the growth of algae. Choice(B) talks about the depth but not speed. Choice(C) talks about how flow helps in propagation of algae but does not talk about how the growth of algae affects the speed of flow. Choice(D) talks about the number of varieties of algae that are housed in fast flowing water but not about the population of algae. Choice(E) states that the speed of the rivers which house the thickest population of algae is the highest. This goes against the argument that growth of algae reduces speed of water.",
