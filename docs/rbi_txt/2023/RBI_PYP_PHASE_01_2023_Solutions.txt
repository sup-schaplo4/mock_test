Q.1) Ans: (a)
EXP: In 2022, the Basic Statistical Return(BSR) system completed 50 years since its inception. To commemorate this milestone, the RBI deputy governor delivered a speech at the conference on ‘BSR@50 organised in Mumbai. The exam of RBI Grade B 2023 Phase 1 took place on July 9, 2023. This question is stating that not only the six months prior to the exam but all the events and initiatives of RBI which are in the news in the past one year are important.

Q.2) Ans: (d)
EXP: Annual Report of RBI needs to be covered for RBI’s exam- this is something that goes without saying. RBI is the regulator of banks in India. Therefore, you can expect questions from this report in any kind of banking exam at any level- be it assistant, clerk, PO etc. Annual reports of the regulators(RBI, SEBI, NABARD, IRDAI, PFRDA, and IFSCA) are very crucial. They can be asked in depth in any kind of exam.

Q.3) Ans: (b)
EXP: This question is from the indices and reports topic, which is an integral part of your Phase 1 and Phase 2 syllabus of RBI. Be prepared for such lengthy questions in future. Try to develop a fast-reading habit.

Q.4) Ans: (c)
EXP: This question is a very basic current affairs question. The President of our nation has received the highest civilian honour of another country – a very expected question, isn’t it? The only challenge here is that the question is lengthy and a little twisted with a lot of unnecessary information. Therefore, I recommend all of you to read as much as you can to at least complete 65-70 such long questions in 25 minutes.

Q.5) Ans: (e)
EXP: This question has been asked from the Foreign Trade Policy released in March 2023, w.e.f., 1st April 2023. This question is an expected question. New towns of excellence were also announced in this year’s policy and asking the criteria for this category is not a difficult or an unexpected question. The lesson that all of you should learn is that prepare all the important reports, policy frameworks, master directions released in the past one year from the date of examination.

Q.6) Ans: (b)
EXP: The trilateral highway project was first proposed and approved at a ministerial meeting of India, Myanmar and Thailand in April 2002. The highway will be connecting Kolkata to Bangkok via Myanmar. This is also not an unexpected question. The RBI has developed a tendency to go beyond the surface. Therefore, it asks the questions from the static initiatives (like this), macro-economic developments, and overarching scenarios/topics. Try to cover every topic holistically.

Q.7) Ans: (a)
EXP: Again, the question has been asked from an initiative which has macro-economic implications. India is working towards net zero-emissions, SDG attainment, energy trAnsition, climate change mitigation, and e-vehicles. Considering the focus of India, this question is relevant and not unexpected. So, not only facts but do keep an eye on the policies of the govt which can become a question in your exam(like this), even if the intiative or campaign was launched 2-3-5 years back, doesn’t matter.

Q.8) Ans: (a)
EXP: This question is from the latest Economic Survey. It is a very important topic of your current affairs syllabus for almost every type of exam. So, in-depth coverage of such reports is important to clear this exam.

Q.9) Ans: (b)
EXP: On the World Environment Day on June 5, 2023, India has launched its first international cruise. The exam was held on July 9, 2023. One month prior to the exam date, this news came out. All the news coming in the 4 months prior to the exam become very important.

Q.10) Ans: (d)
EXP: This news also came out in June 2023. That’s why it has been asked in RBI’s exam. In such type of guidance or policies, in-depth coverage is not required because telecom sector is not mainstream to the RBI’s working. Therefore, you can just cover the main points of such guidelines. These guidelines were entirely focused on DCA facilities.

Q.11) Ans: (c)
EXP: This is a May 2023 news. Often students ignore the appointments, awards, sports, and miscellaneous sections of the Spotlight magazine, which, in my opinion, is a very big mistake an aspirant commit.

They are equally important as the international, national, banking news sections.

Q.12) Ans: (d)
EXP: This is a static GK question. Just knowing the total number of countries of international and regional organizations would not serve your purpose now. You also have to look for India’s membership and role in the international organizations.

Q.13) Ans: (a)

Progress has been sluggish for the remaining six sectors — steel, textile, battery, white goods, solar photovoltaic, and automotive — and are yet to receive incentives. This question is from the govt schemes. The news article was published in June 2023. Hence, it has all the reasons to be a part of your question paper. Not only the basics about the scheme but the current news about it should also be covered by you.

Q.14) Ans: (c)
EXP: Again, a question from the static GK and, that too, from international/regional organizations. This topic is also important for the Phase 2 ESI paper.

(1) With each passing moment, we teeter on the precipice of irreversible consequences, where the ravenous appetite for energy conspires with the existential threat of climate change. The dexterous choreography of this transition demands not only the orchestration of technological advancements and innovative solutions but also the harmonization of political will, economic viability, and societal engagement.

EXP: Option B gets eliminated because it says 'All Briefcase is Umbrella' whereas in the conclusion it is given 'Some Briefcase are not Umbrella'. Option C is also eliminated because it says 'No Umbrella is Charger' which is a definite conclusion. So the conclusion 'Some Umbrella not being Charger is a possibility' does not follow because 'no umbrella is charger' is a definite conclusion and hence not a possibility. Option E is also eliminated because it contains 'All umbrella are charger' whereas in the conclusion it is given 'Some Umbrella not being Charger is a possibility.' Option A is also eliminated as it is not possible to make a diagram of it. So, option D should be the answer. The basic diagram of it is as follows: Since only water are truck, so truck cannot be anything else except water. So, all the three conclusion follows from statements in Option D.
Q.149) Ans: (a)
EXP: Option B is eliminated because it says 'No Boxing is Volleyball' which makes the conclusion 'Some Volleyball not being Boxing is a possibility' false because 'no boxing is volleyball' is a definite statement and hence we cannot get a possible conclusion between volleyball and boxing. Option C is eliminated because it contains 'all volleyball are boxing' which makes the conclusion 'some volleyball not being boxing is a possibility' false. Option D is eliminated because it says 'All football are chess' which makes the conclusion 'some football can never be chess' false. Option E is eliminated because it says 'All Boxing are Chess. No Chess is Cricket' which implies 'No boxing is Cricket' which makes the conclusion 'Some boxing can be cricket' false. The basic diagram for Option A is as follows: We can draw possible diagrams for option A to check for possible conclusions.
Q.150) Ans: (d)
EXP: Option C is eliminated because it contains 'No N are R' whereas conclusion I contains 'some N are R'. So, Option E is also eliminated. Option A is also eliminated because it contains 'No O is N' which makes conclusion II false. Option B is also eliminated because 'some N are R' and 'some Z are R' does not always follow. This is because option B contains 'No R is S'. So, option D is the answer and its basic diagram is as follows:

EXP: (A) Differences among non-profit colleges – such as public vs. private – are irrelevant to the argument. (B) This is the correct choice. One alternative reason that might explain the disproportionate aid distribution is that for-profit colleges engaged in fraudulent practices to obtain unneeded financial assistance for their students. This answer choice asserts that this was NOT in fact the case, thereby eliminating this alternative explanation and highlighting a key assumption upon which the statement rests. (C) The actual number of students receiving aid at for-profit vs. non-profit colleges is irrelevant to the statement. (D) The relative educational quality of for-profit vs. non-profit colleges lies outside the scope of the argument, which is focused solely on differences in financial aid distribution. (E) Whether students successfully repay their loans after college is immaterial to the claim made in the statement.

EXP: As per the argument, Max is clearly an incompetent detective as he has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years, i.e., only 1 out of 25. This argument can be weakened by adding an explanation for the low proportion of cases solved by Max and thus, challenging the premise. Option (e) says that since the police chief regards Max as the most capable detective, he assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve, and thus, adds the required explanation.
