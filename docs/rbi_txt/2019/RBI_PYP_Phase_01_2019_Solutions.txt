EXP: The professional who has just been recruited needs to be evaluated over a period of time to know if he/she suits the work environment of the company. So, I is implicit. The statement mentions that the individual's capabilities shall be judged before confirmation. Hence, II is implicit as well.

Q.47) Ans: (d)
EXP: Both assumptions I and II are valid. The statement says that people are returning to “what is left of their homes”, from which we can assume that their homes were almost destroyed. Similarly, because the families are returning to the city, we can assume that they were driven away or left when Isis took over their city. However, assumption III is not valid as we cannot assume if all of the residents had left and none of them supported Isis from the given statement. Hence, option D is the correct answer.

Q.48) Ans: (e)
EXP: None of the courses of action follow. All of them contain a lot of extraneous information and are impractical solutions. Stoping all billionaire diamond traders from travelling to Antigua and Barbuda and the act of Indian High commissioner should go to arrest Mehul Choksi are extreme courses of action, hence they are ruled out. As for Mehul Choksi should seek asylum is an inappropriate course of action in the context of a given statement. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

Q.49) Ans: (b)
EXP: I is a negative suggestion. It is against the accepted norm that a stitch in time saves nine'. Hence, I does not follow II is a positive suggestion. Moreover it also suggests that the government has a chance to take better action by learning from its experience. Hence, II follows.
Only II follows.

Q.50) Ans: (d)
EXP: At first it may seem statement I is the cause and II is effect, but the reduction in the accidents may not be a direct impact of a new traffic light. The first sentence states that the new traffic lights are specially designed to cope with the increasing traffic problems and roadblocks. So, it cannot be said that II is the effect of I. The reduction in the number of accidents could be caused by factors like well-maintained road, speed limits, etc. Statement I is caused by increasing traffic blocks. So, both statements are effects with independent causes.

EXP: Only conclusion I follows from the given statement. We have been told that the PRI has dominated Mexico’s politics for the better part of a century, from which we can easily conclude that they’ve won most of the elections that have been held in Mexico in the last 100 years. Conclusion II does not follow because we do not know for certain of the PRI is going to lose in the coming elections. The statement tells us that the ruling party seems to be at a risk of defeat. Conclusion II does not follow as we do not know the reasons for assuming that the ruling party might not win the upcoming elections. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Q.57) Ans: (d)
EXP: The given statement states that the Rs 500 and 1000 notes were banned with the purpose of curtailing the shadow economy and impeding the use of illegal and fake currency that funds illegal activities and terrorism. From this, we cannot jump to an argument that talks about tackling corruption or one which claims demonetisation to be a failure. Thus, neither of the two arguments can be termed valid. Thus, option D is the correct answer.

Q.58) Ans: (a)
EXP: The given statement says that due to climate changes sea levels are rising and because of this, more than three hundred thousand homes will get flooded every two weeks in the next 30 years. I is an obvious deduction – people who live near the coastlines will be financially and emotionally affected. And II statement may look like an inference but it actually a course of action. A course of action is a procedure to deal with a situation. Second statement layout plan to minimize the effect of green house gas on sea level.

EXP: The following facts can be gathered from the given paragraph: 1. The trains of the Mumbai suburban railways run overcrowded. 2. Accidents occur owing to overcrowded trains. 3. The strikers claim to continue the strike unless the authorities agree to increase the frequency of the trains in those routs. Point 3 indicates that the authorities have not agreed to increase the frequency of the trains in the routes where accidents are common. Thus, we can infer that the railways did not increase the frequency of trains in proportion to the increase in the number of commuters in the past year.

Q.60) Ans: (c)
EXP: Both inferences I and II follow. The given statement says that digital payments have grown in popularity since the government scrapped large value banknotes more than a year ago. We can easily infer that people must have found the new mode of payment easy and convenient, which is why they stuck to this method even after more than a year. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Q.91) Ans: (d)
EXP: The"habitat and biodiversity loss" suggesting"humans to more zoonotic diseases seems contextually absurd". The verb'expose' means'cause someone to be vulnerable or at risk' and is more appropriate at B. Similarily,"a key programme to study the spread of these diseases" will suggest(to produce an idea in the mind) ways to control them. So, words at B and D need to be exchanged. We need a verb at(C). The verb'spread'(the development or growth of something) is appropriate at C. So, words at A and C need to be exchanged. So, the correct answer is D.

Q.92) Ans: (c)
EXP: The meaning of the following words: Multicultural: relating to or containing several cultural or ethnic groups within a society Curriculum: syllabus Ethnic: relating to a population subgroup (within a larger or dominant national or cultural group) with a common national or cultural tradition. Investors: people or organizations that put money into financial schemes, property, etc. with the expectation of achieving a profit. A school can have a syllabus which has a multicultural ethos. Similarly, the word ethnic needs to be replaced with investors to make sense. Words at positions A& B and D& E need to be exchanged to make the sentence grammatically and contextually correct. Thus option C is the correct answer.

Q.93) Ans: (d)
EXP: The word ‘diverse’ means ‘very different’. Since there is one world, there can’t be difference in it. The population, on the other hand, can be diverse as there is so many types of people. Thus, A and E needs to be exchanged. Word B needs to be exchanged with D. The ‘is’ verb after word B states that the noun must be singular. Thus, words at positions A& E and B& D need to be exchanged to make the sentence grammatically and contextually correct. Thus option D is the correct answer.

Q.94) Ans: (b)
EXP: The preposition ‘at’ states that outpatient ____________ must a place where patients visit. Thus, the word C must be replaced with the D to make sense. Word D fits in place of C as well. Thus, Words at position C& D need to be exchanged to make the sentence grammatically and contextually correct. Option B is the correct answer.
Q.95) Ans: (d)
EXP: The word ‘delicate’ is an adjective which only qualifies a noun. ‘Comment’ here is verb and hence the adjective delicate can’t qualify it. The word A needs to be exchanged with a noun. The only noun in the rest of the option is D. Thus, words at position A& D need to be exchanged to make the sentence grammatically and contextually correct.

Q.96) Ans: (b)
EXP: C& F cannot be joined as they combine to form the phrasal verb ‘set off’ which means to start on a trip. The correct sentence would have been ‘I have no idea how to set about changing a tyre on a car’. Part A ends with the preposition with ‘about’ which means ‘on the subject of; concerning’. The apt noun to follow the preposition is ‘the author’ provided in part E. So, A& E can be aptly combined to form a sentence. B& D can be aptly combined to form a sentence as well. The phrase ‘cutting edge’ means ‘the most recent stage in the development of something’. So, the correct option is B.

Q.97) Ans: (e)
EXP: In part B, the verb ‘ensures’ does not agree with the subject ‘we’. So, B cannot be used to form a grammatically correct sentence. Similarly, in part F, the auxiliary ‘are’ does not agree with the noun ‘charge’. So, F also cannot be used to form a grammatically correct sentence. C& D can be used to form a correct sentence, but since there is no option stating, ‘only C-D’, our correct option will be E.

Q.98) Ans: (d)
EXP: Part A is a clause in itself. In order to add a subordinate clause, a conjunction is needed. It fits perfectly with part E, which has the conjunction ‘and’. Thus A-E makes a pair. Part B has no perfect pair and cannot be connected to any other sentences. Statement D and F do not have any conjunction. In case of part E, it will not connect due to rules of parallelism. Part C ends with the article ‘the’. Thus, it needs to be followed by a noun. Thus, it fits perfectly with part F as the statement begins with the noun ‘availability’. Thus, A-E and C-F can be joined to make a perfect pair. The correct option is D.

Q.99) Ans: (a)
EXP: The passage revolves around the topic of ill methods and impractical belief of the officials awarding GIs(Geographical Indications). The most appropriate statement to open the passage is C which mentions that"the officials believe that they have the mandate to push up the number of GIs it awards, while blithely ignoring the rules that govern its issuance".

Q.104) Ans: (c)
EXP: The meanings of the words are: Abandoning: desert or leave something or someone. Ensuring: make sure something will happen. The statement talks about how countries are making the animals move, and ironically, they are not making it easy for their movement.

Q.110) Ans: (d)
EXP: The given sentence talks about the prevailing nature of ‘electoral bonds’ in spite of concerns and doubts regarding the same. The sentence goes on to explain that this is occurring because of rhetorical claims by someone. From the options it is clear that the ruling part is responsible for these ‘rhetorical claims’. Option i – ‘backing’ means help or support and has been used in conjunction with the correct tense format of the sentence. Option ii – ‘endorsement’ also means help or support and it tallies with the sentence structure. Option iii – although ‘backed’ has been used it is in the incorrect tense form. This makes it incorrect. Thus, option D is the correct answer.

Q.111) Ans: (c)
EXP: The given sentence talks about the testification by ‘impeachment’ experts. The ‘misconducts’ have provided a form of example for impeachment which is constitution approved. Usage of ‘perfect example’ or ‘textbook case’ is correct in this situation. But ‘correct case’ does not make the issue clear. Thus, option C is the correct answer.

Q.112) Ans: (d)
EXP: The word ‘regardless’ means ‘despite the prevailing circumstances. Thus, statement i is synonymous to statement ii. Both the statement will have the same meaning. The correct answer is option D.

Q.113) Ans: (a)
EXP: When ‘since’ is used as a conjunction, it is used to introduce a reason. Statement ii and iii does not make sense. Only statement i fits the blank which gives reason why hunters and gatherers ate fruit sporadically. Thus, option A is the correct answer. So, the correct answer is A.

Q.114) Ans: (c)
EXP: In case of part ii, the phrase ‘due to’ means ‘because of’. Thus, it makes sense and is grammatically correct. In case of part i, Preposition ‘in’ does not make sense. Instead, preposition ‘with’ makes sense as explains that with the rise of cloud based blockchain services, experimentation is easier. Thus, the correct answer is option C.

Q.115) Ans: (c)
EXP: Statements I and II are incorrectly inferred according to the passage. In case of statement I, the passage states, in the very beginning, that: “Today, this disappearing act is referred to as “ghosting,” and it’s a practice that’s becoming more prevalent among applicants. Now the tables have turned. It’s employees who more and more often are ghosting employers. With the unemployment rate at a low 3.5%, job seekers are optimistic about the job market, so much so that 28% of job seekers have backed out of an offer after accepting it, with 44% of those doing so for another, more attractive proposition, according to a study.” In case of statement II, the passage states that"candidates who are no longer interested in pursuing opportunities communicate that to hiring managers, whether in the form of an email or a phone call. When the average cost-per-hire is$4,425, the sooner, the better.” Thus, it cannot be inferred hence it is incorrect. The only statement which can be inferred is correctly is III as the passage states: “if any, negative repercussions, McDonald says it’s only a matter of time before their actions catch up to them. Once job seekers ghost, they burn bridges, ones that can be challenging to repair, and with every future job search will come the chance of running into someone from their past.” Thus, option C is the correct answer.

Q.116) Ans: (b)
EXP: Option A is true as the passage states: “. Research from Indeed found that of the 83% of employers who report having been ghosted, 65% say the candidate accepted their offer but failed to show up on day one.” Option C is true as: “...Indeed found that 94% of job seekers who have ghosted say they’ve not experienced many, if any, negative repercussions.” Option D is true as: “McDonald advises that companies stay in constant communication with candidates to minimize the likelihood of them being a no-show. Once they accept, hiring managers should continue correspondence, whether through emails, texts, phone calls or even in-person meetings.” Option E is true as the passage states: “With the unemployment rate at a low 3.5%, job seekers are optimistic about the job market,” The only statement which is false here is option B as ‘ghosting’ means complete disconnection from the employer. Thus, it is not true and the correct answer.
