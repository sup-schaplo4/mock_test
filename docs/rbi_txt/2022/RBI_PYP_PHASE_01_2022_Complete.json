      "text": "On attending a conference, which focused on the role of the services sector in Indian economy I was amazed. The conference gave a very interesting perspective on the role of the service sector in the growth of Indian economy in relation to growth rates in agriculture and industry. The current situation in India is that the growth rate of services has overtaken both agriculture and industry and is now contributing to more than 50% of GDP. The service sector has the highest growth rate and is the least volatile sector. Growth is particularly marked in public services, IT and financial services. In some areas. the growth rate of the service sector is 40-50% due to increased use of mobile technologies. India, therefore, has a service-oriented economy. It does't not have traditional growth models as in China. However, in the process of doing so, it has skipped the manufacturing and has jumped straight from the agriculture stage to the service stage, which is also the main reason for the expansion of the service sector. In fact, the situation now is such that the growth in the service sector can and will support the agriculture and industrial sectors. However, the only setback for Indian economy is the lack of growth in the manufacturing sector which causes dependence on other countries, which is not so desirable in terms of job creation and increased prosperity. Population is also a major concern for the Indian economy as the population of India grows so also does the number of dependents in the population in both the lower and higher age groups. In such a scenario of increasing population, especially in an economy which is still recovering from crisis, growth becomes difficult. For such an economy to grow it has to invest. Currently, the public sector invests more than it saves. The household sector saves in surplus, but it is not increasing so it cannot continue to support private and public sectors. There is a massive need to spend on agriculture and infrastructure development of the country. Apart from that health and education should also be the priority of the government particularly the education of women to reduce the birth rate Choose the word which is most opposite in meaning to the word given in bold as used in the passage.

      "text": "In a reversal of the norm elsewhere, in India policy-makers and economists have become optimists while bosses do the worrying. The country’s Central Bank has predicted that the country’s economy is likely to grow at a double-digit rate during the next 20-30 years. India has the capability with its vast labour and lauded entrepreneurial spirit. But the private sector which is supposed to do the heavy lifting that turns India from the world’s 10th largest economy to the third largest by 2030 has become fed up. Business people often carp about India’s problems, but their irritation this time has a nervous edge. In the first quarter of 2011, GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.8%; in 2005-07, it managed 9-10%. The economy may be slowing naturally as the low interest rates and public spending that got India through the global crisis are belatedly withdrawn. At the same time, the surge in inflation caused by exorbitant food prices has spread more widely, casting doubt over whether India can grow at 8-10% in the medium term without overheating. In India, as in many fast-growing nations, the confidence to invest depends on the conviction that the long-term trajectory is intact, and it is that which is in doubt. Big Indian firms too sometimes seem happier to invest abroad than at home, in deals that are often hailed as symbols of the country’s growing clout, but sometimes speak of its weaknesses ‒ purchases of natural resources that India has in abundance, but struggles to get out of the ground. In fact, a further dip in investment could be self-fulfilling if fewer roads, ports and factories are built, this will hurt both short-term growth figures and reduce the economy’s long- term capacity. There is a view that because a fair amount of growth is assured, the government need not try very hard. The liberalisation reforms that began in 1991 freed markets for products and gave rise to vibrant competition. At the same time, what economists call factor markets, those for basic inputs like land, power, labour etc. remain unreformed and largely under state control, etc. which creates difficulties. Clearances today can take three to four years and many employers are keen to replace workers with machines despite an abundance of labour force. This can be attributed to labour laws which are inimical to employee creation and to the education system, that means finding quality manpower is a major problem. In fact, the Planning Commission concluded that even achieving 9% growth will need marked policy action in unreformed sectors. 20 years ago, it was said that the yardstick against which India should be measured was its potential and it is clear that there remains much to do. What impact has the GDP growth of 7.8% had? 1) Indian Industry is anxious about India’s economic growth. 2) India has achieved status as the world’s third economy at present. 3) Foreign investment in India has drastically increased",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "ABC Bank has a rate of interest of 12% and compounds half yearly. This is the same as having a 6% interest rate per half-year. So, if Principal P is invested for a year in ABC bank, at the end of the year it becomes P(1.06)(1.06)= P(1.1236) Therefore, the interest rate when viewed as a Simple interest scheme is 12.36% per annum. Seema invested in GHI Bank, which has twice the interest rate as DEF Bank and the quantum for which the investment is made is also double, hence Seema effectively gets 4 times the interest that Sameer gets for the same investment in ABC Bank. Let’s say Sameer invested Rs 20,000 in DEF Bank. Since this is the same as investing in ABC Bank for 1 year, his interest would be 12.36% of 20,000= Rs 2472. Now, for the same investment, Seema must earn 4 times that of Rs 2472. So, Seema earns Rs 9888.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Let’s assume speed of the bus to be x and the time taken be t. Since speed is reduced to 2/3rd, New speed= 2x/3 Since the speed is two-third, time taken= 3t/2 This 3t/2 is after the scheduled time, so extra t/2= 45 minutes t= 90 minutes Bus travels at x km/h& takes 90 min. And, bus travels at 2x/3 km/h takes 135 minutes. So, the bus usually takes 90 minutes to cover the distance. It travels 10 minutes at the usual speed. That is, it travels 1/9th of the time at the usual speed. So, it covers 1/9th of the distance in 10 minutes. To reach its destination on time, the bus has to travel the remaining 8/9th of the distance in 80 minutes. Since the bus halts for 5 minutes, it should now cover 8/9th of the distance in 75(80-5) minutes. In other words, the bus has to cover the same distance in 75/80th of the usual time. In order to do so, the speed must be 80/75th of the usual speed. Or the increased speed will be 5/75th or 1/15th of the usual speed, which is an increase of 6.67%.",
