EXP: In these types of questions, we multiply capital by time and then find the mutual profit ratio. Capital invested by B= ‘p’ Then, capital invested by A= ‘2000+ p’ Now, A=(200+ p) x 8 months= 16,000+ 8p B= p x 12 months= 12p Profit sharing ratio between A and B= 16000+ 8p: 12p= 4000 + 2p: 3p 7F2= 472- √576 F= 8 So, 400F= 3200 Share of A= 400F=((4000+ 2p)/(4000+ 5p)) x 6800 3200/6800=(4000+ 2p)/(4000+ 5p) (4000+ 2p)/(4000+ 5p)= 8/17 p= investment of B= 6000

Q.124) Ans: (d)
EXP: From statement A, we get Price of variety A= Rs 36 Mean price= 57.6/ 1.2= Rs 48 But statement A alone is not sufficient. From statement B, we get Price of variety B= Rs 50 If we combine both A and B, Ratio= 2: 12= 1: 6 1: 6 has a gap of 5 This gap of 5 represents 3 kg. Now we can find out the answer. Note: We don’t ned to find the exact value since this is a data sufficiency question.

Q.125) Ans: (e)
EXP: From the statement A: P= 1000 and A= 1331 so interest will become 1331-1000= 331 From the statement B: Time= 3 years but we could not conclude that the rate of interest was compounded annually or half-yearly. From the statement C: we can conclude that the rate of interest was compounded annually because the simple interest of one year will be equal to the compound interest of the first year only if the rate of interest is compounded annually. Now P= 1000, CI= 331 time=3 years and rate of interest is compounded annually so we can easily find the rate of interest. So, all the statements are needed to get our answer.

EXP: Speed of 1st boat, b1= 21 Speed of 2nd boat, b2= 28 Speed of stream, s= 7 1st boat downstream speed= b1+ s= 28 1st boat upstream speed= b1 – s= 14 2nd boat downstream speed= b2+ s= 35 2nd boat upstream speed= b2 – s= 21 Let the distance between A to B= ‘d’ d/28+ d/14- d/35- d/21= 6.5 d= 210 km

Q.127) Ans: (a)
EXP: From the Statement A, Let the CP of each of two cheapest articles= x and the CP of costliest article= x+ 1 Then, x+ x+ x+ 1= 49, x= 16 Therefore, the CP of costliest article= 16+ 1= 17 From the Statement II, we can say that the cost price of two articles is same and from Statement III, we can say that the cost price of costliest article is 6.25% more than the cost price of cheapest article therefore by combining both the statement we can also get our answer.

Q.128) Ans: (b)
EXP: ABC Bank has a rate of interest of 12% and compounds half yearly. This is the same as having a 6% interest rate per half-year. So, if Principal P is invested for a year in ABC bank, at the end of the year it becomes P(1.06)(1.06)= P(1.1236) Therefore, the interest rate when viewed as a Simple interest scheme is 12.36% per annum. Seema invested in GHI Bank, which has twice the interest rate as DEF Bank and the quantum for which the investment is made is also double, hence Seema effectively gets 4 times the interest that Sameer gets for the same investment in ABC Bank. Let’s say Sameer invested Rs 20,000 in DEF Bank. Since this is the same as investing in ABC Bank for 1 year, his interest would be 12.36% of 20,000= Rs 2472. Now, for the same investment, Seema must earn 4 times that of Rs 2472. So, Seema earns Rs 9888.

Q.129) Ans: (b)
EXP: Let’s assume speed of the bus to be x and the time taken be t. Since speed is reduced to 2/3rd, New speed= 2x/3 Since the speed is two-third, time taken= 3t/2 This 3t/2 is after the scheduled time, so extra t/2= 45 minutes t= 90 minutes Bus travels at x km/h& takes 90 min. And, bus travels at 2x/3 km/h takes 135 minutes. So, the bus usually takes 90 minutes to cover the distance. It travels 10 minutes at the usual speed. That is, it travels 1/9th of the time at the usual speed. So, it covers 1/9th of the distance in 10 minutes. To reach its destination on time, the bus has to travel the remaining 8/9th of the distance in 80 minutes. Since the bus halts for 5 minutes, it should now cover 8/9th of the distance in 75(80-5) minutes. In other words, the bus has to cover the same distance in 75/80th of the usual time. In order to do so, the speed must be 80/75th of the usual speed. Or the increased speed will be 5/75th or 1/15th of the usual speed, which is an increase of 6.67%.

Q.151) Ans: (a)
EXP: A is an implicit assumption because the last line talks about the role of punishment in a healthy moral ecosystem which implies that a healthy moral ecosystem is desirable. Although the passage talks about the importance of punishment, it does not imply that forgiving is a bad practice as nothing has been mentioned about it. So, B is not an implicit assumption. C is also not an implicit assumption because it contains the word 'at times' which becomes conditional. Also, punishment is mentioned for wrong doings and not wrong persons. The concept of wrong persons has not been mentioned.

Q.175) Ans: (b)
EXP: For conclusion I: D<A From statements I, II and III, we get: D<K=Y<C≤A Here, the common sign between D and A is '≤', hence D≤A. Thus, conclusion I does not follow individually. For conclusion II: A=D From statements I, II and III, we get: D≤K=Y≤C≤A Here, the common sign between D and A is '≤', hence D≤A. Thus, conclusion II does not follow individually. On combining conclusion I and II we get D≤A. Therefore, either conclusion I or II follows. For conclusion III: L>Y From statements I and II, we get: Y≤C≤A≤L Thus, the common sign between Y and L is '≤', Therefore Y≤L is the true relationship. Hence conclusion III does not follow.

Q.176) Ans: (d)
EXP: For conclusion I: P>X From statements II and III, we get: X≥G<H<M<P Here, we can see the opposite sign between P and X, thus no relationship can be established between them. Thus, conclusion I does not follow. For conclusion II: G<P From statements I, II and III, we get: G<H<M<P Here, the common sign between G and P is '<'. Hence G<P. Hence conclusion II follows. For conclusion III: Y<H From statements I and III, we get: Y<M>H Here, we can see the opposite sign between Y and H, thus no relationship can be established between them. Thus, conclusion III does not follow. Therefore, only conclusion II follows.
