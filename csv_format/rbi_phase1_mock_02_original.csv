,English Language,"The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument.
