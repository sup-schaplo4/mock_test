      "questions": "A road construction project has been going on in State Y and was due to be completed two months ago. The government of that time had extended the deadline of the project by three months and also allowed truck carrying the raw material to pass through city 2 in order to speed up the process. Yet the construction work is further delayed and is not likely to get over in the extended deadline as well. Which of the following may NOT be a reason for the delay of construction work in State Y?",

        "A": "the workers have started going on strike and off since the past four months as they demanding higher wages.",

        "D": "Due to several complaints by the residents living in the vicinity of the construction site, the construction work is done for four hours less than the usual construction hours since paid four months.",

Statement B states that the dispute on the land is going on in the court where road is to be constructed. Statement C states that due to heavy rainfall in state Y construction work gets affected. Statement D states that construction work is affected due to complaint of local residents. Statement E states that traffic jam is huge in the city in the morning as well as evening.

So N was born in Feb. Take case 1: ● S is 2nd to the left of N. ● P is one month elder to Q. So P was born in March. The number of person is elder to T is same as younger to P. 5 persons are younger to P so T must born in June. ● The one who was born in June is 2nd to the right of the one who was born in February. ● R is the youngest person and neighbor of T. R was born in August. ● O is 3rd to the left of R. ● P is facing outside. All the position of in the middle is occupied so this case gets rejected. Take case 2: ● The one who was born in June is 2nd to the right of the one who was born in February. ● P is one month elder to Q. So P was born in May. The number of person is elder to T is same as younger to P. 3 persons are younger to P so T must born in April. ● As we know that N was born in Feb. S is 2nd to the left of N. ● R is the youngest person and neighbor of T. R was born in August. ● O is 3rd to the left of R. ● The one who was born in January is 2nd to the left of O. ● P is facing outside as P was born in May so P was exactly between N and S. ● So M was born in Jan. ● S is elder to O so S was born in March and O was born in July.

      "questions": "Direction: In the question given below, one statement is followed by three assumptions numbered I, II, and III. Read the statement carefully and decide which of the given assumptions are implicit in the statement. Statement: Overwhelmed with grief and anger, families have been returning to what is left of their homes in the Old City of Mosul, following its liberation from Isis, the terrorist organization. Assumptions: I. The terrorist organization, Isis, destroyed the Old City of Mosul before they left. II. Most of the residents of Mosul had left/ been driven away when Isis took over their city. III. None of the residents of Mosul supported Isis, which is why they left the city.",

        "E": "If none of the assumptions are implicit"

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Both assumptions I and II are valid. The statement says that people are returning to “what is left of their homes”, from which we can assume that their homes were almost destroyed. Similarly, because the families are returning to the city, we can assume that they were driven away or left when Isis took over their city. However, assumption III is not valid as we cannot assume if all of the residents had left and none of them supported Isis from the given statement. Hence, option D is the correct answer.",

Inference II follows directly from the use of the word ‘famed’, meaning famous and well-known, to describe Tutankhamun’s pharaoh.

Two persons are sitting between G and B who likes Pink. A is 3rd to the left of F. F is neighbor of B. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. B is neighbor of E. The number of persons between the one who likes Pink and the one who likes Banana is same as the one who likes Apple and the one who likes Blue. Two persons are sitting between the one who likes Blue and the one who likes Brown. The one who likes Red sits 2nd to the left of the one who likes Black. How many persons are sitting between C and the one who likes brown?",
      "options": {
        "A": "6",
        "B": "4",
        "C": "8",
        "D": "9",
        "E": "5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Seven persons are sitting in the line. Hence, option B. As we know that the both persons whom are sitting at the ends like fruits then two persons are likes fruit. The number of persons is unknown. C likes Banana. It means C is either at the right end or the left end. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. It means clearly the one who likes Apple must be at some ends. As the one who likes Apple is right of B then it must be at the right end then C must be at the left end. Two persons are sitting between C and E. B is neighbor of E. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. If B sits at the immediate left of E then only 5 persons will be in the line but if count in the questions it’s already more than 5 then B must be immediate right of E. Now clearly seven persons are sitting in the line. Two persons are sitting between G and B who likes Pink. A is 3rd to the left of F. F is neighbor of B. The number of persons between the one who likes Pink and the one who likes Banana is same as the one who likes Apple and the one who likes Blue. It means three persons are sitting between the one who likes Apple and the who likes Blue. So A likes Blue. Two persons are sitting between the one who likes Blue and the one who likes Brown so F likes Brown. The one who likes Red sits 2nd to the left of the one who likes Black so G likes Red and E likes Black. Here is the final arrangement:",

Freelancer is a term which refers to the person who is self-employed not working or committed to a particular employer or client for the long-term anywhere.

      "questions": "Passage: The sense that justice requires punishment for wrongs runs deep and is not the same as a mere thirst for revenge or a desire to get even. On the contrary, punishment plays an important role in any healthy moral ecosystem. Statements: (A) Healthy moral ecosystem is desirable. (B) Forgiving is a bad practice.

Although the passage talks about the importance of punishment, it does not imply that forgiving is a bad practice as nothing has been mentioned about it. So, B is not an implicit assumption. C is also not an implicit assumption because it contains the word 'at times' which becomes conditional. Also, punishment is mentioned for wrong doings and not wrong persons.
