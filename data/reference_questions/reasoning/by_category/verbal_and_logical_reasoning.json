      "questions": "Consider the below symbols and their meaning: ‘A^ B’ means ‘A is either greater than or equal to B’ ‘A% B’ means ‘A is neither greater than nor smaller than B’ ‘A? B’ means ‘A is neither smaller than nor equal to B’ ‘A! B’ means ‘A is neither greater than nor equal to B’ ‘A+ B’ means ‘A is either smaller than or equal to B’. Which of the following symbols should be placed in the blank spaces in order to complete the given expression in such a manner that makes the expressions ‘J^ F’ and ‘K? G’ true?  K? J% H___ G^ F! E",

      "explanation": "'J^ F' means J ≥ F 'K? G' means K> G K? J% H___ G^ F! E K> J= H___ G ≥ F< E So, either '=' or '≥' will make both the expressions true. So, Option E is the right answer.",
