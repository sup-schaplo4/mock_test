Arguments: I. This was the best way to tackle corruption and to stop the use of counterfeit cash. II. Demonetisation looks like a bad idea, badly executed on the basis of some half-baked notions.",

      "explanation": "The given statement states that the Rs 500 and 1000 notes were banned with the purpose of curtailing the shadow economy and impeding the use of illegal and fake currency that funds illegal activities and terrorism. From this, we cannot jump to an argument that talks about tackling corruption or one which claims demonetisation to be a failure. Thus, neither of the two arguments can be termed valid. Thus, option D is the correct answer.",
