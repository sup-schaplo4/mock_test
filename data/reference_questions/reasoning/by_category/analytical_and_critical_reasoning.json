Clearly, D was screened second i.e. on 24th, Wednesday. From II, one movie was screened between A and B. So, A and B were screened first and third, i.e. on 23rd and 25th. But, A was not screened on 25th. So, A was screened on 23rd and B on 25th. Thus, C was screened on 26th, Friday. Data in both the statements I and II together is sufficient to answer the question",

People prefer to work on their own terms and conditions and still make more money than what they could make in a 9-5 job. But tax filing is something which scares them a lot here. We are dealing with the tax implications for freelancers, bloggers and consultants in India. Mostly freelancers and consultants ask the question whether they have to pay income tax on their income. The answer is yes and in addition to income tax, they are also liable to pay service tax if their gross income is more than 10 lakh from freelancing as per the rate prescribed by the government. Freelancer is a term which refers to the person who is self-employed not working or committed to a particular employer or client for the long-term anywhere. Within Indian law, if you are running your own business then you are termed as the sole proprietor and the same thing applied to the freelancers. Inference: No one likes to work in 9-5 jobs.",

Gross income is total revenue received and net income is whatever left after the business expense and some tax-free investments etc. If a person is having net income more than 10 lakh then their gross income is even more than that. Therefore they will come in the tax bracket. But here, the type of income is not mentioned. Hence, option C is the correct response.",

Similarly, because the families are returning to the city, we can assume that they were driven away or left when Isis took over their city. However, assumption III is not valid as we cannot assume if all of the residents had left and none of them supported Isis from the given statement. Hence, option D is the correct answer.",

      "questions": "Statement: The use of artificial intelligence in the workplace is increasing rapidly. This trend is likely to lead to significant job losses in the coming years. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the conclusion drawn above?",
      "options": {

        "E": "The benefits of artificial intelligence outweigh the potential costs."
      },
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "explanation": "As per the argument, Max is clearly an incompetent detective as he has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years, i.e., only 1 out of 25. This argument can be weakened by adding an explanation for the low proportion of cases solved by Max and thus, challenging the premise. Option (e) says that since the police chief regards Max as the most capable detective, he assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve, and thus, adds the required explanation.",
