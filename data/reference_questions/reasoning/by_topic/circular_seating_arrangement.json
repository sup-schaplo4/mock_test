They are sitting in such a way that four of them sit at four corners of the square while four sit in the middle of each of the four sides. The ones who sit at four corners face inside while those who sit in the middle of the sides face outside. They were born in different months from January to August but in the same year, not necessarily in the same order. Q was born in a month which has 30 days and facing the centre. The one who is 3rd to the right of Q is 2 months elder to Q. The number of person elder to T is same as younger to P. Only one person is elder to N. The one who was born in June is 2nd to the right of the one who was born in February. S is 2nd to the left of N. R is the youngest person and neighbour of T. P is one month elder to Q.

So Q was either born in April or June. ● The one who is 3rd to the right of Q is 2 months elder to Q. So that person either born in February or April. ● Only one person is elder to N. So N was born in Feb. Take case 1: ● S is 2nd to the left of N. ● P is one month elder to Q. So P was born in March. The number of person is elder to T is same as younger to P. 5 persons are younger to P so T must born in June. ● The one who was born in June is 2nd to the right of the one who was born in February. ● R is the youngest person and neighbor of T. R was born in August. ● O is 3rd to the left of R. ● P is facing outside. All the position of in the middle is occupied so this case gets rejected. Take case 2: ● The one who was born in June is 2nd to the right of the one who was born in February. ● P is one month elder to Q. So P was born in May. The number of person is elder to T is same as younger to P. 3 persons are younger to P so T must born in April. ● As we know that N was born in Feb.

R was born in August. ● O is 3rd to the left of R. ● The one who was born in January is 2nd to the left of O. ● P is facing outside as P was born in May so P was exactly between N and S. ● So M was born in Jan. ● S is elder to O so S was born in March and O was born in July.
