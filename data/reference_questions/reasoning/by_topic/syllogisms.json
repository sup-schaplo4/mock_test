      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Option B gets eliminated because it says 'All Briefcase is Umbrella' whereas in the conclusion it is given 'Some Briefcase are not Umbrella'. Option C is also eliminated because it says 'No Umbrella is Charger' which is a definite conclusion. So the conclusion 'Some Umbrella not being Charger is a possibility' does not follow because 'no umbrella is charger' is a definite conclusion and hence not a possibility. Option E is also eliminated because it contains 'All umbrella are charger' whereas in the conclusion it is given 'Some Umbrella not being Charger is a possibility.' Option A is also eliminated as it is not possible to make a diagram of it. So, option D should be the answer. The basic diagram of it is as follows: Since only water are truck, so truck cannot be anything else except water. So, all the three conclusion follows from statements in Option D.",
