The persons whom are sitting at the both ends like Fruits and the persons whom are sitting in the middle like Colors. C likes Banana. Two persons are sitting between C and E. Two persons are sitting between G and B who likes Pink. A is 3rd to the left of F. F is neighbor of B. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. B is neighbor of E. The number of persons between the one who likes Pink and the one who likes Banana is same as the one who likes Apple and the one who likes Blue.

The number of persons is unknown. C likes Banana. It means C is either at the right end or the left end. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. It means clearly the one who likes Apple must be at some ends. As the one who likes Apple is right of B then it must be at the right end then C must be at the left end. Two persons are sitting between C and E. B is neighbor of E. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. If B sits at the immediate left of E then only 5 persons will be in the line but if count in the questions it’s already more than 5 then B must be immediate right of E. Now clearly seven persons are sitting in the line. Two persons are sitting between G and B who likes Pink. A is 3rd to the left of F. F is neighbor of B. The number of persons between the one who likes Pink and the one who likes Banana is same as the one who likes Apple and the one who likes Blue. It means three persons are sitting between the one who likes Apple and the who likes Blue. So A likes Blue. Two persons are sitting between the one who likes Blue and the one who likes Brown so F likes Brown. The one who likes Red sits 2nd to the left of the one who likes Black so G likes Red and E likes Black. Here is the final arrangement:",
