      "questions": "What is the meaning of the code ‘pullu’ in a code language? I. In that code language ‘rem tez kullu pullu tullu’ means ‘sher singh is my son’ and ‘gullu sullu rullu pullu’ means ‘is he at home’. II. In that code language ‘nel pullu kullu dela’ means ‘my daughter is nirmala’ and ‘setha gama lala’ means ‘sit with me’.",

      "explanation": "From I: In that code language rem tez kullu pullu tullu means ‘Sher Singh is my son’ and ‘gullu sullu rullu pullu’ means ‘is he at home’. Therefore, code for'is' is'pullu' in the given coded language from statement I alone. From II: In that code language nel pullu kullu dela means ‘my daughter is Nirmala’ and setha gama lala means ‘sit with me’. There are no common word in both statements therefore we cannot determine meaning of “pullu” is given coded language from statement II alone.",
