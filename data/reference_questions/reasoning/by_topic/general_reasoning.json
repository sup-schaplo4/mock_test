      "questions": "Situations: Farmers of State D, who traditionally cultivate crop M, bore considerable losses owing to deficiency of nutrient Z in the soil which is vital for adequate growth of crop M. However, this year the farmers registered a 40% growth in production. I. The farmers of State D have started producing crop Y only (which does not require nutrient Z for growth) since the past two years. II. Since the past two years the farmers of State D have been adding a fertilizer to the soil which contains nutrient Z. III. The nutrition this year was 200 more than the previous year in state D.",

      "explanation": "In statement I, farmers of state D starts producing crop Y which does not require nutrient Z for its growth which is the result of given situation. Statement II states that farmers of state D start adding fertilizers in their crops which contains nutrient Z which is the result of given situation as farmers registered a growth of 40% in production. Statement III states that nutrition this year was 200 more than the previous year in state D which is also the result of given situation. Hence all the statements support the given situation.",

The one who lives in Nashik studies with H in the same class, but not in Class XI. D does not live in Nashik. E lives in Siliguri. The one who lives in Patna studies in an odd numbered class. Neither H nor D lives in Bhopal. Case 1: A studies in class II. | Person |Class |City | | ---|---|---| | A |II |Bhopal | | D |II |Ujjain | | |V |Varanasi | | |V |Jaipur | | |VIII |Nashik | | H |VIII |Chennai | | E |IX |Siliguri | | |IX |Patna | Case 2: A studies in class VIII. | Person |Class |City | | ---|---|---| | A |VIII |Nashik | | H |VIII |Ujjain | | |V |Varanasi | | |V |Jaipur | | D |II || | |II || | |IX |Patna | | |IX || 3. B and G study in different classes. B lives neither in Jaipur nor in Nashik. G is senior to both B and H. Neither B nor the one who lives in Siliguri study in the same class as D. C is junior to F. This is not possible in case 2. So, case 1 is correct. Case 1: A studies in class II. | Person |Class |City | | ---|---|---| | A |II |Bhopal | | D |II |Ujjain | | B |V |Varanasi | | C |V |Jaipur | | F |VIII |Nashik | | H |VIII |Chennai | | E |IX |Siliguri | | G |IX |Patna | Hence, the one who lives in Jaipur studies in class V is the correct statement.",

Clearly, D was screened second i.e. on 24th, Wednesday. From II, one movie was screened between A and B. So, A and B were screened first and third, i.e. on 23rd and 25th.

Assumptions: I. The terrorist organization, Isis, destroyed the Old City of Mosul before they left. II. Most of the residents of Mosul had left/ been driven away when Isis took over their city. III.

Similarly, because the families are returning to the city, we can assume that they were driven away or left when Isis took over their city. However, assumption III is not valid as we cannot assume if all of the residents had left and none of them supported Isis from the given statement. Hence, option D is the correct answer.",

Inferences: I. It was previously assumed that there were secrets chambers or other mysteries hidden behind Tutankhamun’s burial chamber. II.

Inference I follows because the very fact that such scans were conducted is evidence that people believed there might be hidden chambers behind the walls. Inference II follows directly from the use of the word ‘famed’, meaning famous and well-known, to describe Tutankhamun’s pharaoh.

      "questions": "Study the information given below and answer the questions based on it. Less than 10 persons are sitting in a straight line and facing north. The persons whom are sitting at the both ends like Fruits and the persons whom are sitting in the middle like Colors. C likes Banana. Two persons are sitting between C and E. Two persons are sitting between G and B who likes Pink. A is 3rd to the left of F. F is neighbor of B. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. B is neighbor of E. The number of persons between the one who likes Pink and the one who likes Banana is same as the one who likes Apple and the one who likes Blue. Two persons are sitting between the one who likes Blue and the one who likes Brown. The one who likes Red sits 2nd to the left of the one who likes Black. How many persons are sitting between C and the one who likes brown?",

        "E": "5"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Seven persons are sitting in the line. Hence, option B. As we know that the both persons whom are sitting at the ends like fruits then two persons are likes fruit. The number of persons is unknown. C likes Banana. It means C is either at the right end or the left end. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. It means clearly the one who likes Apple must be at some ends. As the one who likes Apple is right of B then it must be at the right end then C must be at the left end. Two persons are sitting between C and E. B is neighbor of E. The one who likes Apple sits 2nd to the right of B. If B sits at the immediate left of E then only 5 persons will be in the line but if count in the questions it’s already more than 5 then B must be immediate right of E. Now clearly seven persons are sitting in the line. Two persons are sitting between G and B who likes Pink. A is 3rd to the left of F. F is neighbor of B. The number of persons between the one who likes Pink and the one who likes Banana is same as the one who likes Apple and the one who likes Blue. It means three persons are sitting between the one who likes Apple and the who likes Blue. So A likes Blue. Two persons are sitting between the one who likes Blue and the one who likes Brown so F likes Brown. The one who likes Red sits 2nd to the left of the one who likes Black so G likes Red and E likes Black. Here is the final arrangement:",

      "questions": "The number of freelancers and consultants are at a steep rise in India. The credit for this goes to wider internet penetration. People prefer to work on their own terms and conditions and still make more money than what they could make in a 9-5 job. But tax filing is something which scares them a lot here. We are dealing with the tax implications for freelancers, bloggers and consultants in India. Mostly freelancers and consultants ask the question whether they have to pay income tax on their income. The answer is yes and in addition to income tax, they are also liable to pay service tax if their gross income is more than 10 lakh from freelancing as per the rate prescribed by the government. Freelancer is a term which refers to the person who is self-employed not working or committed to a particular employer or client for the long-term anywhere. Within Indian law, if you are running your own business then you are termed as the sole proprietor and the same thing applied to the freelancers. Inference: If the income of freelancers is more than 10 lakh then they are liable to pay service tax.",

      "explanation": "In line 9th-10th it is mentioned that if gross income is more than 10 lakh then they are liable to pay service tax. Gross income and net income are different. Gross income is total revenue received and net income is whatever left after the business expense and some tax-free investments etc. If a person is having net income more than 10 lakh then their gross income is even more than that. Therefore they will come in the tax bracket. But here, the type of income is not mentioned. Hence, option C is the correct response.",

Not more than three people buy the same item. E buys table before Wednesday. Three people go to the market between E and B. The one who goes to the market on Thursday buys Chair. A goes to the market immediately before G. Two people go to the market between G and F. Only A and the one who goes to the market on Saturday buy Lamp. F neither goes to the market on Thursday nor buy lamp. Only one people goes to the market between D who buys Table and the one who buys Chair. C does not buy table.
