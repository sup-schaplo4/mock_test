      "questions": "Situations: Farmers of State D, who traditionally cultivate crop M, bore considerable losses owing to deficiency of nutrient Z in the soil which is vital for adequate growth of crop M. However, this year the farmers registered a 40% growth in production. I. The farmers of State D have started producing crop Y only (which does not require nutrient Z for growth) since the past two years. II. Since the past two years the farmers of State D have been adding a fertilizer to the soil which contains nutrient Z. III. The nutrition this year was 200 more than the previous year in state D.",

Statement: Recent radar scans of Tutankhamun's tomb conclusively prove that there are no additional chambers or passages behind the walls of the famed pharaoh's burial chamber in the Valley of the Kings, Egyptian officials announced today. Inferences: I. It was previously assumed that there were secrets chambers or other mysteries hidden behind Tutankhamun’s burial chamber. II.

Inference I follows because the very fact that such scans were conducted is evidence that people believed there might be hidden chambers behind the walls. Inference II follows directly from the use of the word ‘famed’, meaning famous and well-known, to describe Tutankhamun’s pharaoh. And inference III follows because we have been told about the function of radar scans – they penetrate walls and help figuring out things on the other side.

We are dealing with the tax implications for freelancers, bloggers and consultants in India. Mostly freelancers and consultants ask the question whether they have to pay income tax on their income. The answer is yes and in addition to income tax, they are also liable to pay service tax if their gross income is more than 10 lakh from freelancing as per the rate prescribed by the government. Freelancer is a term which refers to the person who is self-employed not working or committed to a particular employer or client for the long-term anywhere.

      "questions": "Statement: Studies have shown that lead in drinking water is a significant cause of lung cancer. However, industrial pollution is not the only source of lead in drinking water. Which of the following can be validly inferred from the above statement? Inferences: I) Lead in drinking water is absolutely safe. II) Lung cancer must have causes other than lead in drinking water. III) Lead in drinking water must have sources other than industrial pollution.",

        "E": "none of the above"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The statement portrays about the impact of lead in drinking water, in causing cancer. Inference I – states that lead is safe, which contradicts the statement, hence this option can be omitted. Other inferences II and III talks about the impacts of lead causing cancer, hence option D is the correct choice.",

      "questions": "Statement: Green marketing is concerned with choosing, modifying, and promoting products and services that are environmentally benign. Which of the following can be validly inferred from the above statement? Inferences: I) All products and services that are environmentally benign are promoted through green marketing.

      "explanation": "A conclusion logically completes an idea that has been mentioned in the paragraph. The last few lines of the paragraph describe that the people who are aware of the effects of the environment or the availability of alternative products that do not harm the environment only tend to use them. So, more awareness must be created. So, Option D is the most suitable answer.",
