      "questions": "It is believed that algae grows faster in slow-flowing water. On the other hand, it is also argued that growth of algae causes hindrance to the flow of water. As more algae grows the speed at which water flows decreases. Which of the following, if true, would most appropriately weaken the argument that growth of algae reduces speed of water?",

Choice(C) talks about how flow helps in propagation of algae but does not talk about how the growth of algae affects the speed of flow. Choice(D) talks about the number of varieties of algae that are housed in fast flowing water but not about the population of algae. Choice(E) states that the speed of the rivers which house the thickest population of algae is the highest. This goes against the argument that growth of algae reduces speed of water.",

      "questions": "Statement: For-profit colleges serve far fewer students than either public or private non-profit colleges. At the same time, relative to non-profit colleges, for-profit colleges draw a disproportionate share of federal and state financial aid, such as tuition grants and guaranteed loans, for their students. It must be, then, that for-profit colleges enrol a greater proportion of financially disadvantaged students than do non-profit colleges.

One alternative reason that might explain the disproportionate aid distribution is that for-profit colleges engaged in fraudulent practices to obtain unneeded financial assistance for their students. This answer choice asserts that this was NOT in fact the case, thereby eliminating this alternative explanation and highlighting a key assumption upon which the statement rests. (C) The actual number of students receiving aid at for-profit vs. non-profit colleges is irrelevant to the statement. (D) The relative educational quality of for-profit vs. non-profit colleges lies outside the scope of the argument, which is focused solely on differences in financial aid distribution.
