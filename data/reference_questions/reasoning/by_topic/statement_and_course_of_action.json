      "questions": "A road construction project has been going on in State Y and was due to be completed two months ago. The government of that time had extended the deadline of the project by three months and also allowed truck carrying the raw material to pass through city 2 in order to speed up the process. Yet the construction work is further delayed and is not likely to get over in the extended deadline as well. Which of the following may NOT be a reason for the delay of construction work in State Y?",

Statement: Children are more susceptible than adults to diseases caused by chemical pesticide residues in food, a recent research report by a food committee states. Courses of Action: I. Every family should have a kitchen garden where they can grow their own food. II. Parents should try and ensure that children eat more organic and locally grown food that is free of pesticides. III.

The first sentence states that the new traffic lights are specially designed to cope with the increasing traffic problems and roadblocks. So, it cannot be said that II is the effect of I. The reduction in the number of accidents could be caused by factors like well-maintained road, speed limits, etc. Statement I is caused by increasing traffic blocks.
