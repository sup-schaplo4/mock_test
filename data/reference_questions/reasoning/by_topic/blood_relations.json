      "explanation": "Family member: 8(Susheel, Geeta, Vinit, Chetan, Sonu, Pankaj, Aashi and Seema) Male= Female= 4 members and two married couples. Symbols used in diagrams, 1) Chetan is the husband of Pankaj’s Daughter in law. 2) Neither Seema nor Sushil is married to Chetan. 3) Susheel’s sister has one son. 4) Vinit is the maternal grandfather of Aashi’s father as Vinit does not have any son. (Clearly, Aashi is from fourth generation and unmarried and Vinit is from first generation) 5) Sonu is unmarried and is not the son of Chetan or Seema. 6) Susheel is not married to Pankaj, who is father in law of Sonu’s mother. 7) Susheel’s nephew has one son and one daughter. (Hence, Susheel is from second generation and is a female. As chetan is not married to Seema and Sonu is unmarried, Chetan is married to Geeta and Pankaj is married to Seema. Sonu is unmarried and is the daughter of Chetan and Ashi is the son of chetan) So, the complete family tree is, Hence, Aashi is the son of Geeta.",
