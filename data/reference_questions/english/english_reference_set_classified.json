      "questions": "Read the given passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. When Panagiotis Korfoksyliotis set up a business in Athens in 2011, ferrying tourists around by car, he hoped to do his bit to help Greece emerge from its deep recession. He says he paid his staff a decent wage and declared all his earnings. Unfortunately, the taxman did not repay the kindness. Sharp increases in business taxes have prompted Mr Korfoksyliotis to pack his bags and move his company and his life to Bulgaria. Now he employs drivers to take foreign visitors around that country’s tourist spots instead. He is part of a growing trend. In recent years Greek governments desperate for cash have sought to squeeze it from companies, despite evidence that this is driving them away to places like Bulgaria, Cyprus and Albania. The combination of a deep recession and rising taxation has meant that by some estimates more than 200,000 businesses have closed or in some cases left Greece since then. Between 2009 and 2014 the taxable profits declared by the country’s businesses fell by more than €5 billion ($5.6 billion) to €10 billion. Precise figures are hard to find, but accountants, lawyers and businesspeople reckon that perhaps as many as 10,000 Greek-owned firms have moved abroad. In a recent survey of 300 firms, Endeavor Greece, a non-profit organisation that helps entrepreneurs, found that more than a third had either left or were thinking about going. Venetis, a bakery chain, recently said that, because of high taxes and capital controls, it will focus more on opening shops abroad than in Greece. Even if they have kept their Greek operations going, some multinationals have moved their headquarters. Fage International, a dairy firm, said in 2012, when taxes started to rise, that it would move its base to Luxembourg. That year Coca-Cola Hellenic, which distributes the American giant’s soft drinks in 28 mostly European countries, moved its base from Athens to Zug in Switzerland. In 2013 Viohalco, a metals-processor, moved its head office to Brussels. The latter two firms say that the main reason was to improve their access to capital. But Greece’s sharp tax rises were hardly an inducement to stay. Other euro-crisis countries, such as Portugal and Ireland, cut business taxes or kept them low, to encourage investment and growth. (Portugal’s corporation-tax revenues are only slightly below where they were, as a share of GDP, before the global financial crisis.) But Greece has raised its corporation-tax rate from 20% in 2012 to 29% in 2015, even though international lenders such as the IMF will surely have advised against this. Greece’s tax rise makes Bulgaria’s rate of just 10% even more alluring; likewise Cyprus’s 12.5% rate and Albania’s 15%. The country’s neighbours are delighted that it is sending business their way. Panagiotis Pantelis, an accountant in Athens, says he has been busy in recent weeks meeting officials from neighbouring countries on behalf of clients looking to move out. Alexandros Ziniatis of Viva Trust, a firm that advises businesses seeking to relocate within Europe, reports similarly brisk interest from Greek companies. The new leader of Greece’s conservative opposition, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has condemned the tax rises on business as counterproductive. But the left-wing ruling coalition is not listening. It is now proposing a 20% rise in a levy on companies’ profits that goes toward pensions. Carry on in this vein, and there will not be many businesses, or much profit, left to tax. Source: https://www.economist.com/busin ess Which of the following is true in the context of the passage?",

        "B": "Despite the imposition of excessive tax by the government on business companies, not a single company migrated to other countries.",
        "C": "Greece, unlike any other European country, has been a victim of the European Crises.",

Source: https://www.economist.com/busin ess Which of the following have been the consequences of the recession in Greece? I. Despite having their businesses running in Greece, many countries moved their headquarters to foreign countries. II. A large number of companies closed because they were unable to pay the exorbitant taxes. III.

        "A": "Greece is no more business friendly as the government is arbitrarily imposing inordinate taxes.",
        "B": "Mr Korfoksyliotis will get better opportunities of investment in Bulgaria than in Greece.",

Option A uses the phrase incorrectly, and “beating around the bush” would fit more appropriately than “grasping at straws”.

Hence, in the given context a word like “legend” would be more appropriate. Canonized fits well with the context of the Church of Rome. Again, “emollient” is an adjective, but we require a verb to show what the new cult would do to the memory of Hus. Thus, words synonymous as well as opposite in meaning to “strengthen” can be used.

      "questions": "Read the given passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. The fact that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Palestine just weeks after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured India demonstrates just why rising powers like New Delhi can play a significant role in building peace between Israel and Palestine, and in the broader Middle East. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem irreparably damaged the United States’ image as a credible arbiter in the Israel- Palestine conflict. In contrast, rising powers like India are considered acceptable by a broad range of regional players. From a U.S. perspective, the strategic entry of new these into the Middle East will be increasingly difficult to prevent. The involvement in the peace process of India—a fellow democracy and security partner of Washington— provides a preferable option when compared to other rising powers who may seek to fill the void. While Delhi has increased security ties with Israel, it has simultaneously strengthened ties with the Palestinian Authority. Its “friend-to-all” image enabled New Delhi to garner an invitation from Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas to sit on a proposed “multilateral forum” for negotiations on a peace deal between Palestine and Israel—a role India is increasingly able to fill. Many assessed the pomp and ceremony of Netanyahu’s New Delhi visit as evidence of India’s increasing proximity to Israel. The public affection reflected New Delhi’s strategic interests. The Indian military has relied on Israeli technology on the battlefield; last year India and Israel signed a $2 billion deal for an advanced medium-range surface-to-air missile system. Israel has positioned itself as one of India’s largest source of arms, with a 7.2 percent share of imports into India between 2012 and 2016. But while the ideological stripes of the current BJP government and certain security interests mean Israeli overtures are warmly received, there are significant structural factors that drive India to maintain a balanced approach to the Israel-Palestine issue. The rhetoric about “dehyphenating” Israel-Palestine is an attempt to justify this objectivity to those seeking to pull India into supporting one side over the other. While no bilateral relationship is fully independent of other relationships, counteracting forces acting upon Indian policymakers ensure New Delhi takes a relatively neutral approach. Indian policymakers feel that in an increasingly multipolar world, the way to maximize leverage is to make other states work for one’s favor rather than have it taken for granted through alliance membership. Thus, what had previously been promoted as idealist nonalignment has now evolved and been rebranded as realist strategic independence. Importantly, India is seen as able to act more independently than many Western states with regard to Israel. This is evident in the fact that when Israel’s preferences collide with New Delhi’s strategic autonomy, the latter always wins out. Modi’s visit to Palestine is a prime example. Furthermore, despite Israel and the United States urging that India minimize its energy and defense ties with Iran, India continues to rely on Iranian oil and engage in defense cooperation. Modi even visited Iran in 2016 and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani arrived in India this week for his own visit. The rhetoric throughout Modi’s trips to Iran and Palestine included references to the depth of ties, similar to those heard during the Indian prime minister’s trip to Israel. Modi’s speeches in Ramallah will likely be similarly replete with themes of camaraderie and “brotherliness.” For global audiences, India projects an image of moderation with regard to its positions on the Middle East’s conflicts. While Delhi has prioritized sovereignty and nonintervention, providing soft-spoken support to like Syria and pre-2003 Iraq, in opposition to the West, the re-entry of Russia into the region and its robust defense of Damascus makes New Delhi’s position more centrist.

The Indian military has relied on Israeli technology on the battlefield; last year India and Israel signed a $2 billion deal for an advanced medium-range surface-to-air missile system. Israel has positioned itself as one of India’s largest source of arms, with a 7.2 percent share of imports into India between 2012 and 2016. But while the ideological stripes of the current BJP government and certain security interests mean Israeli overtures are warmly received, there are significant structural factors that drive India to maintain a balanced approach to the Israel-Palestine issue. The rhetoric about “dehyphenating” Israel-Palestine is an attempt to justify this objectivity to those seeking to pull India into supporting one side over the other. While no bilateral relationship is fully independent of other relationships, counteracting forces acting upon Indian policymakers ensure New Delhi takes a relatively neutral approach. Indian policymakers feel that in an increasingly multipolar world, the way to maximize leverage is to make other states work for one’s favor rather than have it taken for granted through alliance membership. Thus, what had previously been promoted as idealist nonalignment has now evolved and been rebranded as realist strategic independence. Importantly, India is seen as able to act more independently than many Western states with regard to Israel. This is evident in the fact that when Israel’s preferences collide with New Delhi’s strategic autonomy, the latter always wins out. Modi’s visit to Palestine is a prime example. Furthermore, despite Israel and the United States urging that India minimize its energy and defense ties with Iran, India continues to rely on Iranian oil and engage in defense cooperation. Modi even visited Iran in 2016 and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani arrived in India this week for his own visit. The rhetoric throughout Modi’s trips to Iran and Palestine included references to the depth of ties, similar to those heard during the Indian prime minister’s trip to Israel. Modi’s speeches in Ramallah will likely be similarly replete with themes of camaraderie and “brotherliness.” For global audiences, India projects an image of moderation with regard to its positions on the Middle East’s conflicts. While Delhi has prioritized sovereignty and nonintervention, providing soft-spoken support to like Syria and pre-2003 Iraq, in opposition to the West, the re-entry of Russia into the region and its robust defense of Damascus makes New Delhi’s position more centrist.

      "questions": "Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions. Certain words are printed in bold to help you locate them while answering some of the questions. In the public's eye, military men are still the sole sufferers of PTSD. But research shows that women are in some cases twice as likely to develop the disorder. Despite being far more vulnerable, women are often misdiagnosed due to cultural stereotypes, and there's a huge gap in research on which kinds of treatments work best for which kinds of people. Studies and research programs have been designed, until recently, to understand men with PTSD. The same is true for support systems and treatment centers. In the legal system, women who report PTSD from rape are less likely to be believed than men who report PTSD from combat. Research shows that women are at a higher risk of PTSD. While men experience more traumatic events in their lives, women are, depending on which study you look at, as much as twice as likely to develop PTSD, but no one really knows why. Pervasive male prejudice against women is another factor that can diminish unit cohesion for female soldiers. Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD. For women, this hesitation to self-identify as a sufferer of PTSD could be even greater; historically, female soldiers have struggled to be counted as equals to men on the battlefield. Women, stereotypically considered to possess less emotional fortitude than men, may be unwilling to admit that they are suffering from PTSD lest they appear to conform to this stereotype. That domestic bit has another face too: Where men who've experienced trauma might be able to take time off to recover, women are expected to maintain their domestic, caregiving roles, which make it harder for women to address symptoms of post-traumatic stress for fear of \"failing\" at their roles as mother, daughter and wife. \"Gendered social roles can compound the negative impact,\" said Dawne Vogt, a research psychologist at the Women's Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD. \"So they might have additional stress when they're dealing with something. \"Technically, PTSD is largely the same for men and women, characterized by things like fear based anxiety, sleep disturbance, flashbacks, feelings of detachment and more. And both men and women often experience multiple conditions alongside PTSD. But they seem to develop different sets of additional problems. Women tend to develop depression alongside their PTSD, while men tend to tack on substance abuse. What that means is that men with PTSD tend to show a different profile than women do. Men tend to lash out, showing anger, hostility, explosiveness and unpredictability. Women, often because of their depression, tend to do the opposite, becoming withdrawn and turning to self harm. What is clear is that women who return from combat, with PTSD or not, often have a harder time returning to their lives. According to a report by the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Labor and Housing and Urban Development, \"America's nearly 300,000 women veterans are put at risk by a system designed for and dominated by male veterans.\" This includes lack of access to peer support, group therapy and specialized mental health care for things like PTSD. Recent changes made by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have improved treatment options for female veterans living with PTSD, but there is still more that needs to be done. Women veterans are also more likely to be unemployed than male veterans, and at least twice as likely to be homeless. On top of that, women veterans are more likely to be single parents and come back to dependents. But Vogt says that nobody knows how this might impact their PTSD, or which treatments might work best. And it's not necessarily clear that what works for veterans will work for civilians either. Right now, for example, most of the research on virtual reality uses for treating PTSD focuses on military men.Another challenge is that until very recently, treatment for PTSD has been more difficult for women than men to obtain. Before rule changes were enacted in 2010, only veterans who encountered direct combat experience qualified to receive disability payments for PTSD. Because very few women are placed on the front lines, very few were eligible to receive free treatment for PTSD. However, recent regulation changes have ended these stipulations, allowing women who serve in any capacity to be eligible for benefits. Even if female veterans are eligible for these benefits, the quality of the care a wartime PTSD sufferer receives can vary widely. The United States Department of Veterans Affair(VA) pays disability benefits to service men and women who have been diagnosed with PTSD and also provides these individuals with free health care. But while mental health counseling that comes directly from VA doctors is completely free to veterans, there are often long waiting lists for those who need to be evaluated or treated. Therapy provided by non-VA professionals may not be covered by health insurance. Access to mental health professionals who have been specially trained to treat wartime PTSD is often difficult for those not living near major urban centers. On both the research level and the policy level, more must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country Figuring out which treatment works best for PTSD is still an ongoing process for everybody, men and women alike. But if researchers want to help treat people equally, they'll need to include more women. What is the style of the passage?",

Descriptive writing's main purpose is to describe. It is a style of writing that focuses on describing a character, an event, or a place in great detail. Narrative writing's main purpose is to tell a story. The author will create different characters and tell you what happens to them(sometimes the author writes from the point of view of one of the characters Persuasive writing's main purpose is to convince. Unlike expository writing, persuasive writing contains the opinions and biases of the author. An argument paragraph presents a point of view and provides evidence for the point of view taken. An argument is an opinion supported by facts. Writers refer to opinions as claims and facts as evidence.",

      "questions": "Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions. Certain words are printed in bold to help you locate them while answering some of the questions. In the public's eye, military men are still the sole sufferers of PTSD. But research shows that women are in some cases twice as likely to develop the disorder. Despite being far more vulnerable, women are often misdiagnosed due to cultural stereotypes, and there's a huge gap in research on which kinds of treatments work best for which kinds of people. Studies and research programs have been designed, until recently, to understand men with PTSD. The same is true for support systems and treatment centers. In the legal system, women who report PTSD from rape are less likely to be believed than men who report PTSD from combat. Research shows that women are at a higher risk of PTSD. While men experience more traumatic events in their lives, women are, depending on which study you look at, as much as twice as likely to develop PTSD, but no one really knows why. Pervasive male prejudice against women is another factor that can diminish unit cohesion for female soldiers. Because women are less likely than men to experience unit cohesion while serving in the military, women are less likely to develop the social support structures that will help prevent them from developing PTSD. For women, this hesitation to self-identify as a sufferer of PTSD could be even greater; historically, female soldiers have struggled to be counted as equals to men on the battlefield. Women, stereotypically considered to possess less emotional fortitude than men, may be unwilling to admit that they are suffering from PTSD lest they appear to conform to this stereotype. That domestic bit has another face too: Where men who've experienced trauma might be able to take time off to recover, women are expected to maintain their domestic, caregiving roles, which make it harder for women to address symptoms of post-traumatic stress for fear of \"failing\" at their roles as mother, daughter and wife. \"Gendered social roles can compound the negative impact,\" said Dawne Vogt, a research psychologist at the Women's Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD. \"So they might have additional stress when they're dealing with something. \"Technically, PTSD is largely the same for men and women, characterized by things like fear based anxiety, sleep disturbance, flashbacks, feelings of detachment and more. And both men and women often experience multiple conditions alongside PTSD. But they seem to develop different sets of additional problems. Women tend to develop depression alongside their PTSD, while men tend to tack on substance abuse. What that means is that men with PTSD tend to show a different profile than women do. Men tend to lash out, showing anger, hostility, explosiveness and unpredictability. Women, often because of their depression, tend to do the opposite, becoming withdrawn and turning to self harm. What is clear is that women who return from combat, with PTSD or not, often have a harder time returning to their lives. According to a report by the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Labor and Housing and Urban Development, \"America's nearly 300,000 women veterans are put at risk by a system designed for and dominated by male veterans.\" This includes lack of access to peer support, group therapy and specialized mental health care for things like PTSD. Recent changes made by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have improved treatment options for female veterans living with PTSD, but there is still more that needs to be done. Women veterans are also more likely to be unemployed than male veterans, and at least twice as likely to be homeless. On top of that, women veterans are more likely to be single parents and come back to dependents. But Vogt says that nobody knows how this might impact their PTSD, or which treatments might work best. And it's not necessarily clear that what works for veterans will work for civilians either. Right now, for example, most of the research on virtual reality uses for treating PTSD focuses on military men.Another challenge is that until very recently, treatment for PTSD has been more difficult for women than men to obtain. Before rule changes were enacted in 2010, only veterans who encountered direct combat experience qualified to receive disability payments for PTSD. Because very few women are placed on the front lines, very few were eligible to receive free treatment for PTSD. However, recent regulation changes have ended these stipulations, allowing women who serve in any capacity to be eligible for benefits. Even if female veterans are eligible for these benefits, the quality of the care a wartime PTSD sufferer receives can vary widely. The United States Department of Veterans Affair(VA) pays disability benefits to service men and women who have been diagnosed with PTSD and also provides these individuals with free health care. But while mental health counseling that comes directly from VA doctors is completely free to veterans, there are often long waiting lists for those who need to be evaluated or treated. Therapy provided by non-VA professionals may not be covered by health insurance. Access to mental health professionals who have been specially trained to treat wartime PTSD is often difficult for those not living near major urban centers. On both the research level and the policy level, more must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country Figuring out which treatment works best for PTSD is still an ongoing process for everybody, men and women alike. But if researchers want to help treat people equally, they'll need to include more women. According to the passage, what makes PTSD harder for a female veteran as compared to a male veteran? I. Women also suffers from depression alongside their PTSD, because of their depression, they self-harm themselves. II. Women are not able to take time off to recover from PTSD because females give more importance and time in maintaining their domestic roles as compared to treatment of their PTSD. III. Most female veterans refuse to seek treatment",

Based on information in the passage, which of the following statements best reflects the author’s opinion about the mental health care provided for female veterans?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Although the VA has not done nearly enough, state and independent agencies have made up for government deficiencies.",
        "B": "The government has done almost nothing to help; the way we treat our female veterans is a national disgrace.",
        "C": "Because service women are more likely than service men to develop PTSD, mental health care has been better for female veterans.",
        "D": "The VA and other government agencies have attempted to provide mental health care for female veterans, but most of them refuse to seek treatment.",
        "E": "The amount of care provided has improved over the past few years, but it is still insufficient"
      },
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "explanation": "In passage, author states that due to “recent changes,” there are now “improved treatment options” for female veterans suffering from PTSD. The author also discusses a rule change that now makes mental health counseling available to women who have not served in combat positions, which increases women’s eligibility for benefits. Despite these improvements, the author suggests in the final paragraph that the amount of care provided is still insufficient by stating, “More must be done to help the women who have sacrificed so much for their country.” Based on this information, we can determine that the author believes the amount of care provided has improved over the past few years, but it is still insufficient. Therefore(E) is correct. The author does not suggest that state and independent agencies have made up for government deficiencies, so(A) is incorrect. Although the author is critical of the government, he or she is not so harsh as to suggest that the government has done almost nothing to help. This makes(B) incorrect. The author claims that mental health care has been worse for female veterans as compared to males, not better, so(C) is incorrect. The author goes on to explain that women may be even more hesitant to ask for help than men because of negative gender stereotypes. However, the author does not suggest that most female veterans refuse to seek treatment. This eliminates(D).",

      "explanation": "Part A is a clause in itself. In order to add a subordinate clause, a conjunction is needed. It fits perfectly with part E, which has the conjunction ‘and’. Thus A-E makes a pair. Part B has no perfect pair and cannot be connected to any other sentences. Statement D and F do not have any conjunction. In case of part E, it will not connect due to rules of parallelism. Part C ends with the article ‘the’. Thus, it needs to be followed by a noun. Thus, it fits perfectly with part F as the statement begins with the noun ‘availability’. Thus, A-E and C-F can be joined to make a perfect pair. The correct option is D.",

The sentence goes on to explain that this is occurring because of rhetorical claims by someone. From the options it is clear that the ruling part is responsible for these ‘rhetorical claims’. Option i – ‘backing’ means help or support and has been used in conjunction with the correct tense format of the sentence. Option ii – ‘endorsement’ also means help or support and it tallies with the sentence structure. Option iii – although ‘backed’ has been used it is in the incorrect tense form.

Most every job seeker has, at some point, either applied to or interviewed for a position only to be met by radio silence. Follow-up emails go unanswered, and the once-promising opportunity vanishes into the void. A few years ago, this might simply have been called part of the job hunt. Today, this disappearing act is referred to as “ghosting,” and it’s a practice that’s becoming more prevalent among applicants. Now the tables have turned. It’s employees who more and more often are ghosting employers. With the unemployment rate at a low 3.5%, job seekers are optimistic about the job market, so much so that 28% of job seekers have backed out of an offer after accepting it, with 44% of those doing so for another, more attractive proposition, according to a study. If multiple companies are pursuing one candidate, he or she may accept the first offer, set a start date and then receive and accept a second offer without letting the first company know. Research from Indeed found that of the 83% of employers who report having been ghosted, 65% say the candidate accepted their offer but failed to show up on day one. Some 27% ceased communication after getting a counteroffer from their current employer and 19% after hearing negative feedback about the company. And job seekers aren’t only ghosting employers after accepting offers, says McDonald, who has first-hand experience with this phenomenon. Some are bailing on interviews, while others are completing several rounds of interviews before shutting down the lines of communication. How can employers avoid this fate? McDonald advises that companies stay in constant communication with candidates to minimize the likelihood of them being a no-show. Once they accept, hiring managers should continue correspondence, whether through emails, texts, phone calls or even in-person meetings. At the end of the day, though, it’s really up to the candidates. While Indeed found that 94% of job seekers who have ghosted say they’ve not experienced many, if any, negative repercussions, McDonald says it’s only a matter of time before their actions catch up to them. Once job seekers ghost, they burn bridges, ones that can be challenging to repair, and with every future job search will come the chance of running into someone from their past.

With the unemployment rate at a low 3.5%, job seekers are optimistic about the job market, so much so that 28% of job seekers have backed out of an offer after accepting it, with 44% of those doing so for another, more attractive proposition, according to a study. If multiple companies are pursuing one candidate, he or she may accept the first offer, set a start date and then receive and accept a second offer without letting the first company know. Research from Indeed found that of the 83% of employers who report having been ghosted, 65% say the candidate accepted their offer but failed to show up on day one. Some 27% ceased communication after getting a counteroffer from their current employer and 19% after hearing negative feedback about the company. And job seekers aren’t only ghosting employers after accepting offers, says McDonald, who has first-hand experience with this phenomenon. Some are bailing on interviews, while others are completing several rounds of interviews before shutting down the lines of communication. How can employers avoid this fate? McDonald advises that companies stay in constant communication with candidates to minimize the likelihood of them being a no-show. Once they accept, hiring managers should continue correspondence, whether through emails, texts, phone calls or even in-person meetings. At the end of the day, though, it’s really up to the candidates. While Indeed found that 94% of job seekers who have ghosted say they’ve not experienced many, if any, negative repercussions, McDonald says it’s only a matter of time before their actions catch up to them. Once job seekers ghost, they burn bridges, ones that can be challenging to repair, and with every future job search will come the chance of running into someone from their past. He advises that candidates who are no longer interested in pursuing opportunities communicate that to hiring managers, whether in the form of an email or a phone call. When the average cost-per-hire is $4,425, the sooner, the better.

      "questions": "On attending a conference, which focused on the role of the services sector in Indian economy I was amazed. The conference gave a very interesting perspective on the role of the service sector in the growth of Indian economy in relation to growth rates in agriculture and industry. The current situation in India is that the growth rate of services has overtaken both agriculture and industry and is now contributing to more than 50% of GDP. The service sector has the highest growth rate and is the least volatile sector. Growth is particularly marked in public services, IT and financial services. In some areas. the growth rate of the service sector is 40-50% due to increased use of mobile technologies. India, therefore, has a service-oriented economy. It does't not have traditional growth models as in China. However, in the process of doing so, it has skipped the manufacturing and has jumped straight from the agriculture stage to the service stage, which is also the main reason for the expansion of the service sector. In fact, the situation now is such that the growth in the service sector can and will support the agriculture and industrial sectors. However, the only setback for Indian economy is the lack of growth in the manufacturing sector which causes dependence on other countries, which is not so desirable in terms of job creation and increased prosperity. Population is also a major concern for the Indian economy as the population of India grows so also does the number of dependents in the population in both the lower and higher age groups. In such a scenario of increasing population, especially in an economy which is still recovering from crisis, growth becomes difficult. For such an economy to grow it has to invest. Currently, the public sector invests more than it saves. The household sector saves in surplus, but it is not increasing so it cannot continue to support private and public sectors. There is a massive need to spend on agriculture and infrastructure development of the country. Apart from that health and education should also be the priority of the government particularly the education of women to reduce the birth rate Choose the word which is most opposite in meaning to the word given in bold as used in the passage.

      "questions": "In a reversal of the norm elsewhere, in India policy-makers and economists have become optimists while bosses do the worrying. The country’s Central Bank has predicted that the country’s economy is likely to grow at a double-digit rate during the next 20-30 years. India has the capability with its vast labour and lauded entrepreneurial spirit. But the private sector which is supposed to do the heavy lifting that turns India from the world’s 10th largest economy to the third largest by 2030 has become fed up. Business people often carp about India’s problems, but their irritation this time has a nervous edge. In the first quarter of 2011, GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.8%; in 2005-07, it managed 9-10%. The economy may be slowing naturally as the low interest rates and public spending that got India through the global crisis are belatedly withdrawn. At the same time, the surge in inflation caused by exorbitant food prices has spread more widely, casting doubt over whether India can grow at 8-10% in the medium term without overheating. In India, as in many fast-growing nations, the confidence to invest depends on the conviction that the long-term trajectory is intact, and it is that which is in doubt. Big Indian firms too sometimes seem happier to invest abroad than at home, in deals that are often hailed as symbols of the country’s growing clout, but sometimes speak of its weaknesses ‒ purchases of natural resources that India has in abundance, but struggles to get out of the ground. In fact, a further dip in investment could be self-fulfilling if fewer roads, ports and factories are built, this will hurt both short-term growth figures and reduce the economy’s long- term capacity. There is a view that because a fair amount of growth is assured, the government need not try very hard. The liberalisation reforms that began in 1991 freed markets for products and gave rise to vibrant competition. At the same time, what economists call factor markets, those for basic inputs like land, power, labour etc. remain unreformed and largely under state control, etc. which creates difficulties. Clearances today can take three to four years and many employers are keen to replace workers with machines despite an abundance of labour force. This can be attributed to labour laws which are inimical to employee creation and to the education system, that means finding quality manpower is a major problem. In fact, the Planning Commission concluded that even achieving 9% growth will need marked policy action in unreformed sectors. 20 years ago, it was said that the yardstick against which India should be measured was its potential and it is clear that there remains much to do. Which of the following can be said about the Indian economy at present?",

      "questions": "Passage: Third world countries, a term that originated during the Cold War era, refer to the developing nations that faced economic, social, and political challenges in the aftermath of colonialism and globalization. These countries have diverse histories and trajectories, shaped by colonization, post-colonial struggles, and attempts at development. The history of third world countries is marked by the exploitation of resources, cultural suppression, and political subjugation by colonial powers. The aftermath of independence brought hopes of progress and self-determination, but many nations grappled with the daunting task of nation-building and overcoming deep-rooted socio-economic disparities. Despite the challenges, third world countries possess considerable growth prospects. Several nations have made significant strides in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Economic reforms, investments in human capital, and advancements in technology have opened doors for innovation, entrepreneurship, and foreign investments. The emergence of regional cooperation and trade blocs has also fostered economic integration and increased market opportunities. However, third world countries continue to face a myriad of challenges. Poverty, income inequality, and lack of access to basic services remain persistent issues. Political instability, corruption, and inadequate governance hinder progress and create hurdles for sustainable development. Environmental degradation, climate change, and natural disasters pose additional threats to these nations, affecting their agricultural productivity, water resources, and overall resilience. To overcome these challenges and pave the way forward, third world countries must prioritize inclusive and sustainable development. Strengthening governance structures, promoting transparency, and combating corruption are essential for creating an enabling environment for growth. Investment in education and skills development can empower the workforce and foster innovation. Enhanced access to healthcare, clean water, and sanitation is critical for improving the quality of life. Furthermore, third world countries must leverage technological advancements to bridge the digital divide and foster digital literacy. Sustainable agricultural practices, renewable energy initiatives, and climate resilience strategies should be prioritized to mitigate environmental risks. Collaboration and partnerships with international organizations, developed countries, and the private sector can provide valuable support in terms of finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building. In summary, the history, growth prospects, challenges, and the way forward for third world countries are complex and multifaceted. Achieving sustainable development requires addressing systemic issues, embracing innovation, and fostering inclusive growth. It necessitates a global commitment to promoting equity, justice, and shared prosperity. In addition to economic and social challenges, third world countries also face issues related to population growth and urbanization. Rapid population growth puts immense pressure on limited resources and infrastructure, leading to overcrowded cities, inadequate housing, and strained public services. Urbanization presents both opportunities and challenges, as it can drive economic growth and innovation but also exacerbate income inequality and social disparities if not properly managed. Effective urban planning, investment in sustainable urban infrastructure, and social welfare programs are crucial for creating inclusive and livable cities. Another critical aspect in the development of third world countries is the empowerment and inclusion of women. Gender inequality remains a significant obstacle, limiting women’s access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. By ensuring equal rights, addressing cultural norms, and providing support for women’s empowerment, third world countries can unlock the full potential of their human capital and foster inclusive growth. Women’s participation in decision-making processes, entrepreneurship, and leadership roles is key to driving sustainable development and social progress. The way forward for third world countries also necessitates a focus on cultural preservation and promotion. Indigenous knowledge, traditions, and cultural heritage play a vital role in identity formation and community cohesion. Integrating cultural preservation efforts into development strategies can enhance social cohesion, promote cultural diversity, and foster a sense of pride and belonging. Embracing cultural tourism, supporting local artisans and craftsmen, and preserving historical sites contribute to sustainable development while safeguarding cultural heritage for future generations. Moreover, international cooperation and fair global trade are essential for the progress of third world countries. Addressing trade imbalances, promoting fair trade practices, and reducing barriers to market access can create opportunities for economic growth and poverty reduction. Access to affordable finance and technology transfer are crucial for developing industries and fostering innovation. Multilateral institutions and global partnerships should strive to create a level playing field, providing support and resources to ensure the equitable participation of third world countries in the global economy.From the passage: What are some of the challenges related to population growth and urbanization in third world countries?",

      "questions": "Passage: Third world countries, a term that originated during the Cold War era, refer to the developing nations that faced economic, social, and political challenges in the aftermath of colonialism and globalization. These countries have diverse histories and trajectories, shaped by colonization, post-colonial struggles, and attempts at development. The history of third world countries is marked by the exploitation of resources, cultural suppression, and political subjugation by colonial powers. The aftermath of independence brought hopes of progress and self-determination, but many nations grappled with the daunting task of nation-building and overcoming deep-rooted socio-economic disparities. Despite the challenges, third world countries possess considerable growth prospects. Several nations have made significant strides in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Economic reforms, investments in human capital, and advancements in technology have opened doors for innovation, entrepreneurship, and foreign investments. The emergence of regional cooperation and trade blocs has also fostered economic integration and increased market opportunities. However, third world countries continue to face a myriad of challenges. Poverty, income inequality, and lack of access to basic services remain persistent issues. Political instability, corruption, and inadequate governance hinder progress and create hurdles for sustainable development. Environmental degradation, climate change, and natural disasters pose additional threats to these nations, affecting their agricultural productivity, water resources, and overall resilience. To overcome these challenges and pave the way forward, third world countries must prioritize inclusive and sustainable development. Strengthening governance structures, promoting transparency, and combating corruption are essential for creating an enabling environment for growth. Investment in education and skills development can empower the workforce and foster innovation. Enhanced access to healthcare, clean water, and sanitation is critical for improving the quality of life. Furthermore, third world countries must leverage technological advancements to bridge the digital divide and foster digital literacy. Sustainable agricultural practices, renewable energy initiatives, and climate resilience strategies should be prioritized to mitigate environmental risks. Collaboration and partnerships with international organizations, developed countries, and the private sector can provide valuable support in terms of finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building. In summary, the history, growth prospects, challenges, and the way forward for third world countries are complex and multifaceted. Achieving sustainable development requires addressing systemic issues, embracing innovation, and fostering inclusive growth. It necessitates a global commitment to promoting equity, justice, and shared prosperity. In addition to economic and social challenges, third world countries also face issues related to population growth and urbanization. Rapid population growth puts immense pressure on limited resources and infrastructure, leading to overcrowded cities, inadequate housing, and strained public services. Urbanization presents both opportunities and challenges, as it can drive economic growth and innovation but also exacerbate income inequality and social disparities if not properly managed. Effective urban planning, investment in sustainable urban infrastructure, and social welfare programs are crucial for creating inclusive and livable cities. Another critical aspect in the development of third world countries is the empowerment and inclusion of women. Gender inequality remains a significant obstacle, limiting women’s access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. By ensuring equal rights, addressing cultural norms, and providing support for women’s empowerment, third world countries can unlock the full potential of their human capital and foster inclusive growth. Women’s participation in decision-making processes, entrepreneurship, and leadership roles is key to driving sustainable development and social progress. The way forward for third world countries also necessitates a focus on cultural preservation and promotion. Indigenous knowledge, traditions, and cultural heritage play a vital role in identity formation and community cohesion. Integrating cultural preservation efforts into development strategies can enhance social cohesion, promote cultural diversity, and foster a sense of pride and belonging. Embracing cultural tourism, supporting local artisans and craftsmen, and preserving historical sites contribute to sustainable development while safeguarding cultural heritage for future generations. Moreover, international cooperation and fair global trade are essential for the progress of third world countries. Addressing trade imbalances, promoting fair trade practices, and reducing barriers to market access can create opportunities for economic growth and poverty reduction. Access to affordable finance and technology transfer are crucial for developing industries and fostering innovation. Multilateral institutions and global partnerships should strive to create a level playing field, providing support and resources to ensure the equitable participation of third world countries in the global economy.From the passage, Which of the following is not a challenge faced by third world countries?",
