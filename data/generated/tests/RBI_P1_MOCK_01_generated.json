H sits to the immediate right of A. Both G and H face the same direction.\n\nLet's deduce:\nSince B faces the center and A is third to the right, we can place A and B. With two people between B and C, we can place C. D is to the immediate left of C and faces away from the center. E is second to the right of D, and F is opposite to E. G cannot be next to B, and H is to the immediate right of A. Since G and H face the same direction, and we know the directions of other people, we can determine their directions. Final Arrangement (assuming clockwise order and starting with B):\nB(center) - _ - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H/G.\nKnowing all placements from above, H must be next to A and G cannot be next to B. Hence, the final arrangement is B(center) - G - C - D(away) - _ - E - F - A - H. This means that the arrangement is: B(center) - G(away) - C(center) - D(away) - A(center) - H(center) - F(away) - E(center).\n\nTherefore, A is second to the left of E.",

          "question": "Read the passage carefully and answer the question that follows:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently implemented a series of measures aimed at strengthening the asset quality of commercial banks. These measures include stricter norms for recognizing non-performing assets (NPAs), enhanced provisioning requirements for stressed assets, and the introduction of a framework for early recognition and resolution of financial distress. The objective of these measures is to promote greater transparency and accountability in the banking sector, reduce the incidence of evergreening of loans, and ensure timely corrective action to address asset quality concerns. While these measures are expected to improve the long-term health of the banking system, they may also have some short-term implications for banks' profitability and credit growth. Stricter NPA recognition norms could lead to a surge in reported NPAs, which could, in turn, necessitate higher provisioning and lower net profits. Moreover, enhanced provisioning requirements may constrain banks' ability to extend fresh credit, particularly to sectors already facing financial difficulties. Therefore, it is crucial for the RBI to strike a balance between strengthening asset quality and supporting sustainable credit growth.\n\nWhat does the passage imply about the RBI's approach to managing asset quality?",

Moreover, they can be difficult to enforce effectively, particularly in an increasingly interconnected global financial system.

          "question": "Read the passage carefully and answer the question that follows:\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently implemented a series of measures aimed at strengthening the asset quality of commercial banks. These measures include stricter norms for recognizing non-performing assets (NPAs), enhanced provisioning requirements for stressed assets, and the introduction of a framework for early recognition and resolution of financial distress. The objective of these measures is to promote greater transparency and accountability in the banking sector, reduce the incidence of evergreening of loans, and ensure timely corrective action to address asset quality concerns. While these measures are expected to improve the long-term health of the banking system, they may also have some short-term implications for banks' profitability and credit growth. Stricter NPA recognition norms could lead to a surge in reported NPAs, which could, in turn, necessitate higher provisioning and lower net profits. Moreover, enhanced provisioning requirements may constrain banks' ability to extend fresh credit, particularly to sectors already facing financial difficulties. Therefore, it is crucial for the RBI to strike a balance between strengthening asset quality and supporting sustainable credit growth.\n\nWhat is the primary focus of the passage?",
