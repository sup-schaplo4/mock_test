Conditions: 1) The Red box is somewhere to the left of the Blue box and is Light. 2) The Yellow box is Heavy and immediately next to the Pink box. 3) The White box is third from the right. 4) The Green box is heavier than the Red box and is somewhere to the left of the Black box. 5) The Pink box is at one end and is Light.

Ten friends: Alex, Bob, Clara, Dan, Eve, Fiona, Greg, Helen, Isaac, and Jenny are to be arranged in these buildings such that: 1) Alex and Clara live in different buildings but on the same floor. 2) Bob lives two floors above Eve. 3) Dan lives in the same building as Bob. 4) Greg does not live on the ground floor. 5) Fiona and Jenny live on the top floor but in different buildings. 6) Helen lives on the floor below Isaac. 7) Isaac lives in the same building as Alex. Who lives on the third floor of building 1?",

(2) Statement II shows that x is divisible by 3, but doesn't confirm divisibility by 2, making it insufficient alone as well.

          "passage": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary tool used is the manipulation of the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive for banks, which in turn increases lending rates for businesses and consumers. Consequently, demand decreases, leading to a cooling down of prices. However, this approach can also slow down economic growth. The RBI must carefully balance controlling inflation with supporting economic expansion to maintain overall financial stability. Factors such as global commodity prices and monsoon patterns also influence inflation, making the RBI's task complex and multifaceted. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective monetary policy implementation.",

Open banking allows third-party providers to access customer banking data, with the customer's consent, through application programming interfaces, APIs. This enables the development of innovative financial products and services, such as personalized financial advice and streamlined payment solutions. However, open banking also raises concerns about data security, privacy, and the potential for misuse of customer information. Establishing robust regulatory frameworks and ensuring strong data protection measures are essential for fostering trust and realizing the full potential of open banking.

          "question": "Read the passage carefully and answer the question that follows:\n\nThe rise of fintech has presented both opportunities and challenges for traditional banking institutions. On one hand, fintech companies have disrupted the financial landscape with innovative solutions, offering enhanced customer experiences, streamlined processes, and personalized services. This has forced banks to re-evaluate their existing business models and adopt new technologies to remain competitive. On the other hand, fintech poses a threat to banks' market share, profitability, and regulatory compliance. The unbundling of traditional banking services, coupled with the increasing popularity of digital payment platforms and alternative lending models, has eroded banks' traditional revenue streams. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancements has made it difficult for banks to keep up with the evolving regulatory landscape and manage cybersecurity risks. While collaboration between banks and fintech companies can unlock synergies and drive innovation, it also requires careful consideration of data privacy, consumer protection, and systemic risk. Ultimately, the future of banking will depend on how well traditional institutions adapt to the changing competitive environment and leverage fintech to create value for customers and shareholders.\n\nAccording to the passage, which of the following is NOT a challenge posed by fintech to traditional banks?",

While these policies, such as countercyclical capital buffers and loan-to-value ratios, are designed to limit excessive credit growth and asset price bubbles, their effectiveness can be undermined by several factors. These include the difficulty in identifying and measuring systemic risk in real-time, the potential for regulatory arbitrage as financial institutions shift activities to less regulated sectors, and the political pressures to relax macroprudential measures during economic downturns. Moreover, the global interconnectedness of financial markets can amplify the impact of shocks and make it harder for individual countries to effectively manage systemic risk. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to financial stability requires a combination of macroprudential policies, sound microprudential supervision, and international cooperation.\n\nWhat does the passage suggest is needed for a comprehensive approach to financial stability?",
