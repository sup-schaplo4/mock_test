        "E": "forecasting; sanguine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The best fit is 'exacerbating; pragmatic'. 'Exacerbating' aligns with inflationary pressures, and a pragmatic approach suggests prioritizing stability when faced with rising inflation. Sanguine is incorrect in this context. A 'reckless' approach doesn't make logical sense.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "'Evinces; sanguine' is the most appropriate pair. 'Evinces' means to show clearly, and 'sanguine' means optimistic. This contrasts with the analysts' potential concerns, making it logically consistent. 'Taciturn' doesn't fit the context of expressing confidence.",
