      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, as the central bank, plays a crucial role in managing the nation's money supply and credit. Its primary objective is to maintain price stability while fostering economic growth. The RBI employs various instruments like the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to influence the liquidity in the banking system. Changes in these rates impact the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for businesses and individuals. A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates, aims to curb inflation by reducing demand, while an accommodative policy seeks to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends on several factors, including the responsiveness of businesses and consumers to interest rate changes and the overall economic outlook.\n\nWhat is the main goal of the RBI according to the passage?",

      "question": "Quantitative easing (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate economic activity when conventional interest rate policies are ineffective. It involves a central bank injecting liquidity into the money supply by purchasing assets, such as government bonds or mortgage-backed securities, from commercial banks and other institutions. This lowers long-term interest rates, encourages lending, and increases asset prices. QE is typically implemented when inflation is very low or negative and economic growth is stagnant. While QE can be effective in boosting economic activity, it also carries risks, such as inflation and asset bubbles. The effectiveness of QE depends on the specific economic conditions and the credibility of the central bank.\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of quantitative easing (QE)?",

      "question": "The yield curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the interest rates (or yields) and the maturity dates of debt securities. It typically plots the yields of government bonds with different maturities, ranging from short-term to long-term. The shape of the yield curve can provide valuable insights into the state of the economy and expectations about future interest rates and inflation. A normal yield curve slopes upward, indicating that longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds. An inverted yield curve, where short-term yields are higher than long-term yields, is often seen as a predictor of a recession.\n\nWhat does an inverted yield curve often indicate, according to the passage?",

      "question": "Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) are a major concern for the Indian banking system. They represent loans and advances where borrowers have stopped making interest or principal payments. High levels of NPAs erode bank profitability, reduce lending capacity, and increase the risk of financial instability. Several factors contribute to the accumulation of NPAs, including economic slowdowns, project delays, and poor credit appraisal. The Reserve Bank of India has implemented various measures to address the NPA problem, including stricter provisioning norms, asset reconstruction companies, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Resolving the NPA problem is crucial for ensuring the health and stability of the banking sector.\n\nWhat is a key consequence of high levels of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for banks?",

      "question": "The debate surrounding inflation targeting as a primary objective for central banks is ongoing. Proponents argue that a clear inflation target enhances transparency and accountability, allowing central banks to effectively manage expectations and maintain price stability. They believe that focusing solely on inflation provides a simple and easily understood framework for monetary policy. Critics, however, contend that a rigid inflation target can be too restrictive, particularly in the face of supply shocks or financial instability. They advocate for a more flexible approach that considers other factors, such as employment and economic growth, in addition to inflation.\n\nWhat is a criticism of rigid inflation targeting?",

      "question": "The concept of moral hazard is prevalent in the financial sector. It arises when one party engages in risky behavior knowing that another party will bear the cost of that risk. For example, if a bank knows it will be bailed out by the government if it makes bad loans, it may be more likely to engage in risky lending practices. This can lead to excessive risk-taking and financial instability. Regulators attempt to mitigate moral hazard through various measures, such as capital requirements, supervision, and resolution mechanisms. However, eliminating moral hazard entirely is difficult, as it is often inherent in the structure of financial relationships.\n\nWhat is the definition of moral hazard as it relates to the financial sector?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing inflation through its monetary policy. The primary objective is to maintain price stability while supporting economic growth. The RBI uses various tools such as the repo rate, reverse repo rate, and cash reserve ratio to control the money supply in the economy. When inflation rises, the RBI typically increases the repo rate, making it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. This, in turn, leads to higher lending rates for consumers and businesses, which reduces demand and helps to curb inflation. The effectiveness of the RBI's monetary policy depends on several factors, including the fiscal policy of the government and global economic conditions.\n\nWhat is the main function of the RBI as described in the passage?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India employs various instruments to manage inflation, primarily through its monetary policy. The repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI, is a key tool. Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. Conversely, decreasing the repo rate encourages borrowing, increasing the money supply and potentially stimulating economic growth. The cash reserve ratio, the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI, also plays a role. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, while a lower CRR increases their lending capacity. Open market operations, involving the buying and selling of government securities, are another important instrument. Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, while selling securities withdraws liquidity. Effective inflation management requires a delicate balance to avoid stifling economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the RBI when adjusting the repo rate?",

      "question": "The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, plays a crucial role in managing the country's monetary policy. One of its primary tools is adjusting the repo rate, the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI. Lowering the repo rate encourages banks to borrow more, increasing liquidity in the market and stimulating economic activity. Conversely, raising the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive, curbing inflation by reducing the money supply. The RBI also uses tools like the cash reserve ratio, CRR, and statutory liquidity ratio, SLR, to influence the amount of money banks can lend. These measures are carefully calibrated to maintain price stability and promote sustainable economic growth.\n\nWhat is the primary effect of the RBI increasing the repo rate?",
