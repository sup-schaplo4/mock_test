        "E": "forecasting; sanguine"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The best fit is 'exacerbating; pragmatic'. 'Exacerbating' aligns with inflationary pressures, and a pragmatic approach suggests prioritizing stability when faced with rising inflation. Sanguine is incorrect in this context. A 'reckless' approach doesn't make logical sense.",
