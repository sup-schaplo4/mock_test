    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Let the three numbers be A, B, and C.\\nThe average of the three numbers is 45, so (A + B + C) / 3 = 45.\\nThus, A + B + C = 135.\\nThe average of the first two numbers is 40, so (A + B) / 2 = 40.\\nTherefore, A + B = 80.\\nSubstituting in the first equation: 80 + C = 135,\\nwe get C = 135 - 80 = 55.\\nTherefore, the third number is 55.",
