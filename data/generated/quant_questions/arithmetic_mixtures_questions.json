    "question": "A merchant has two types of rice, one costing Rs. 50 per kg and the other Rs. 70 per kg. In what ratio should he mix these two types of rice to get a mixture worth Rs. 60 per kg?",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Using the alligation method, we calculate the difference between each cost and the mean price:\\n\\nLet's do the alligation: \\n\\nCost of type 1 = Rs. 50/kg\\nCost of type 2 = Rs. 70/kg\\nMean price = Rs. 60/kg\\n\\nCalculate the differences:\\n\\nDifference with type 1 = 60 - 50 = 10\\nDifference with type 2 = 70 - 60 = 10\\n\\nThe ratio in which the two types of rice should be mixed is the inverse of these differences.\\n\\nThus, the ratio is 10:10 or 1:1, simplifying further, we get 2:1.
