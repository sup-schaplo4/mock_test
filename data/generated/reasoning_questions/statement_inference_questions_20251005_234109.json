The installation of solar panels directly led to the reduction in carbon emissions.\nII. The policy was effective in reducing the carbon footprint of commercial buildings.\nIII. Other factors, besides solar panels, could have contributed to the decrease in emissions.",

(2) Inference I is not valid as the statement does not establish a direct causal link, only a correlation. Inference II is valid as the policy's effectiveness is evident through the measurable reduction in emissions. Inference III is plausible, but not definitely true from the information provided; it is an assumption about possible other factors.
