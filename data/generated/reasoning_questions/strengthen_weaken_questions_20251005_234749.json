    "question": "A local bakery claims that their new gluten-free bread is as nutritious as their regular whole grain bread, as it contains similar levels of fiber and vitamins. However, sales have decreased since the introduction of the new product. The bakery concludes that their customers do not care about nutritional content when choosing bread.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The gluten-free bread is priced higher than the regular whole grain bread.",
      "B": "Customers of the bakery are more interested in taste than nutritional content.",
      "C": "The gluten-free bread is sold in smaller loaves than the regular whole grain bread.",
      "D": "A survey shows that a significant number of customers have allergies to gluten.",
      "E": "The regular whole grain bread has been on sale at a discount since the new product launch."

    "correct_answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Analysis: (1) The conclusion is that customers do not care about nutritional content. (2) The assumption is that sales decrease is due to lack of interest in nutrition. (3) Option E weakens this by suggesting another reason for the sales dropâ€”price competition, not indifference to nutrition. (4) Other options either support different causes or do not address the primary sales decrease issue directly.",
