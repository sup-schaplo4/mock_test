    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "From W > X and X = Z, we have W > Z (I follows). W > Y cannot be concluded directly since Y ≥ X; thus II does not follow. Z = X and Y ≥ X does not lead to a definite Z ≥ Y, thus III does not follow.",

    "explanation": "From L < M and N = O, O > L, so option A is true. Since K ≠ L, K cannot be M unless more information is given, but it cannot be definitely false without further information. N < L is false because L < M, M ≥ N and N = O implies N cannot be less than L (C is false).",

R = T is not confirmed because S ≠ T provides no direct relationship, and T < R cannot be directly inferred due to lack of direct comparison.",
