    "question": "Five friends - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, and Eva - are sitting around a circular table facing the center. The following conditions are known: 1) Alice sits two places to the right of Bob. 2) Charlie is not sitting next to Eva. 3) David sits directly between Bob and Charlie. 4) Eva sits to the immediate left of Alice. Who is sitting immediately to the right of Charlie?",

    "explanation": "Arrange the friends based on the clues: Start with Bob at position 1. Alice is two places to the right, so Alice is at position 3. Eva is to the immediate left of Alice, so Eva is at position 2. David sits between Bob and Charlie, which places David at position 4 and Charlie at position 5.
