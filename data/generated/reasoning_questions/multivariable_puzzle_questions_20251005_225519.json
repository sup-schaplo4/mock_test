The person on the 1st floor likes Cherry.\n3. The person with Banana is on the 5th floor.\n4. Bob lives on an odd floor and Diane lives immediately above Bob, meaning Bob lives on the 3rd floor and Diane on the 4th.\n5.

      "C": "Lawyer, Germany",
      "D": "Artist, Japan",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "1. The Doctor is fixed in March to UK. 2. The Engineer is in April but not Germany, so possibilities are USA or Canada. 3. Teacher is USA not January or June, so either March or May. March is already occupied by Doctor, so May or February. But February is for Canada, so March is for Teacher USA. 4. The Artist is in May in Japan. 5. Chef is in Australia, not February, which leaves June or April. April is for Engineer, so Chef must be June. 6. Thus, Lawyer is also in June, and they go to Germany as all other options are accounted for.",

Ian and Rabbit must be below 5, so 1-4 range, but not 3 which is Gardening. 4. Cooking is above Mike, 3 becomes Gardening, so Mike is 2 or 1, but due to Ian, 2. 5. 6-7 with Harry, Painting comes below, probably 5, and thus Jack needs between Cycling and Hiking. 6. Kate's Dog means she could be in early floors due to the 2 gap. 7. Linda is above Reading. 8. Nancy below Photography by 3 and enjoys Turtle. 9. Oscar on even with Writing, making it 4/6/8. 10.
