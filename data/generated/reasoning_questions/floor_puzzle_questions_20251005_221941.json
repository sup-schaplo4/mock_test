    "question": "There are six floors in a building numbered 1 to 6, with six people: A, B, C, D, E, and F living on different floors, one on each floor. The following conditions are known:\n1. A lives on an even-numbered floor.\n2. B lives immediately above C.\n3. D lives on the topmost floor.\n4. E does not live on the floor immediately below D.\n5. F lives two floors below B.\nWho lives on the second floor?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "1. Since D is on the topmost floor (Floor 6), and E does not live immediately below D, E cannot be on Floor 5.\n2. A must live on an even-numbered floor, so A must be on either Floor 2 or Floor 4.\n3. B lives immediately above C, which means if C is on Floor 1, B is on Floor 2, and F then must be on Floor 4.\n4. Since A must be on an even-numbered floor, A is on Floor 2 and thus C cannot be on Floor 1.\n5. Therefore, C must be on Floor 2, B on Floor 3, and F on Floor 5.\n6. Therefore, E must live on Floor 1.\nSo the final arrangement is: E - Floor 1, C - Floor 2, B - Floor 3, A - Floor 4, F - Floor 5, D - Floor 6. The person on the second floor is C.",

If T is on Floor 2, U is on Floor 4, which leaves Floor 3 open for either Q or R, but violates the condition since one floor must be between them.\n3. Therefore, T must be on Floor 4, making U on Floor 6.\n4. Q and R must then be on Floors 3 and 1 respectively to maintain one floor between them.\n5.
