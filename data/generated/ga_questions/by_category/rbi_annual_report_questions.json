      "question": "The transmission of monetary policy to outstanding rupee loans was observed to be lower for Public Sector Banks (PSBs) compared to Private Sector Banks (PVBs). What is the primary reason for this difference?",
      "options": {
        "A": "PSBs have a larger share of corporate loans which are less sensitive to repo rate changes.",
        "B": "PSBs have a significantly lower share of EBLR-linked loans and a higher share of loans linked to legacy benchmarks like MCLR and Base Rate.",
        "C": "PVBs were quicker to reduce their Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR).",
        "D": "PSBs' deposit costs did not decrease, preventing them from lowering lending rates.",
        "E": "Regulatory forbearance allowed PSBs to delay the transmission of policy rate changes."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The transmission to WALR on outstanding rupee loans was lower for PSBs due to a comparatively higher share of internal benchmark-based lending rates, viz., MCLR and others. The share of EBLR-linked loans for PVBs (85.9%) was significantly higher than for PSBs (44.6%) as of December 2024. (Page 98)",

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The reviewed ECF widened the range for monetary and financial stability buffers. Consequently, the Contingent Risk Buffer (CRB) would be maintained in the range of 6.0 ± 1.5 per cent of the Balance Sheet size, as against the previous level of 6.5 per cent with a lower bound of 5.5 per cent.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Supervisory Data Quality Index (sDQI) was developed to identify and address deficiencies in risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices across Supervised Entities (SEs). The other options are mismatched: PRAVAAH is for regulatory applications, RB-CRIS is for climate risk data, SAKAR is for KYC/AML risk assessment, and FinTech Repository is for capturing information on FinTech entities.
