The document explicitly calls this trend 'not a healthy mix,' highlighting the concern that investment in less productive assets (structures) is growing much faster than in more productive ones (machinery).",

The Economic Survey 2024-25 (page 46, paragraph 1.22) states that the First Advance Estimate for FY25 real GDP growth is '6.4 per cent'.
