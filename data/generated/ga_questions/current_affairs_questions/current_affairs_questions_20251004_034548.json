      "question": "Given that India's services exports for FY 2024-25 were $350 billion and the services surplus was $170 billion, while merchandise exports stood at $500 billion and the overall current account deficit was $54 billion, what was the approximate value of merchandise imports for that year?",

        "E": "$850 billion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "First, calculate services imports: $350B (exports) - $170B (surplus) = $180B. The trade balance is (Merchandise Exports - Merchandise Imports) + (Services Surplus). The current account deficit (CAD) is the negative of this balance (ignoring remittances for this calculation). So, CAD = -[(500 - Merch. Imports) + 170]. Given CAD = $54B, we have 54 = -[670 - Merch. Imports]. -54 = Merch. Imports - 670. Merch. Imports = 670 - 54 = $616 billion. The source document separately states merchandise imports at $720 billion and trade deficit at $220 billion, with CAD at 1.2% ($54B), indicating remittances and other factors played a role. However, based on the trade data provided ($500B export, $720B import), the merchandise trade deficit is $220B.  With a services surplus of $170B, the combined goods and services deficit is $50B, which aligns closely with the stated CAD of $54B.",
