      "question": "Five friends named Alex, Bob, Charlie, David, and Ethan each live on a different floor of a five-story building. The floors are numbered 1 to 5, with 5 being the top floor. Each friend owns a car of a different color: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Black. Using the clues given, determine who lives on which floor and the color of their car. 1) Alex lives on an odd-numbered floor. 2) The person with the Yellow car lives directly above Alex. 3) Bob's car is Blue and he lives on the top floor. 4) Charlie lives on a higher floor than the owner of the Black car. 5) David lives on the 3rd floor. Who owns the Red car?",

      },
      "correct_answer": "E",
      "explanation": "Based on the clues: Bob is on the 5th floor with the Blue car. David is on the 3rd floor. Alex must be on either 1st or 3rd floor, but since David is on 3rd, Alex is on the 1st floor. Therefore, the Yellow car is on the 2nd floor. Since Charlie lives above the Black car owner and Ethan is the only one left to live on the 4th floor, the Black car must be on the 3rd floor with David. Thus, Ethan, on the 2nd floor with Yellow car, leaves Charlie with the Green car on the 4th floor, and Alex must have the Red car.",

      "question": "A recent study shows that people who consume at least one cup of green tea per day are 20% less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases compared to those who do not consume green tea. Therefore, drinking green tea is a significant preventive measure against cardiovascular diseases. Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?",

        "A": "The study did not account for participants' overall diet and exercise habits.",

      "explanation": "The argument concludes that drinking green tea is a preventive measure against cardiovascular diseases based on a correlation found in a study. The assumption is that green tea directly contributes to this health benefit. Option A weakens the argument by introducing the possibility that other factors like diet and exercise, which were not accounted for in the study, could have influenced the results. This exposes a flaw in the causal link the argument depends on. Other options either do not address this assumption or are irrelevant to the causal claim.",
