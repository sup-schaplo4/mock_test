      "question": "Read the passage carefully and answer the question that follows:\n\nThe rise of fintech has presented both opportunities and challenges for traditional banking institutions. On one hand, fintech companies have disrupted the financial landscape with innovative solutions, offering enhanced customer experiences, streamlined processes, and personalized services. This has forced banks to re-evaluate their existing business models and adopt new technologies to remain competitive. On the other hand, fintech poses a threat to banks' market share, profitability, and regulatory compliance. The unbundling of traditional banking services, coupled with the increasing popularity of digital payment platforms and alternative lending models, has eroded banks' traditional revenue streams. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancements has made it difficult for banks to keep up with the evolving regulatory landscape and manage cybersecurity risks. While collaboration between banks and fintech companies can unlock synergies and drive innovation, it also requires careful consideration of data privacy, consumer protection, and systemic risk. Ultimately, the future of banking will depend on how well traditional institutions adapt to the changing competitive environment and leverage fintech to create value for customers and shareholders.\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of the passage?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To advocate for the complete replacement of traditional banks by fintech companies.",
        "B": "To discourage collaboration between banks and fintech companies.",
