**SOURCE:** Current Affairs compilation ({TIME_PERIOD})

**TASK:** Generate EXACTLY {num_questions} multiple-choice questions from the provided current affairs content.

**DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION:**
- Hard: {difficulty_split['Hard']} questions (analytical, requires connecting multiple events, understanding implications)
- Medium: {difficulty_split['Medium']} questions (moderate complexity, fact-based with context)
- Easy: {difficulty_split['Easy']} questions (straightforward facts, dates, names, figures)

**TOPIC CATEGORIES TO USE:**
{', '.join(CURRENT_AFFAIRS_TOPICS)}

**QUESTION STYLE GUIDELINES:**

‚úÖ DO:
- Start questions naturally without source references
- Use specific dates, names, figures, and event details
- Focus on: Economic events, Banking developments, Government policies, International relations, Appointments, Awards
- Ask about: "What", "Which", "When", "Who", "Where", "How much"
- Make questions time-specific (mention exact months/dates/years)
- Use exact data from the current affairs content
- Cover diverse topics (banking, economy, international, national, awards, etc.)

‚ùå DON'T:
- Start with "According to...", "As per current affairs..."
- Use vague or ambiguous language
- Create hypothetical scenarios
- Fabricate any information
- Repeat similar questions

**EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS:**

‚úÖ "Who was appointed as the new Governor of Reserve Bank of India in December 2024?"
‚úÖ "India's GDP growth rate for Q2 FY 2024-25 was projected at what percentage?"
‚úÖ "Which country hosted the G20 Summit in September 2025?"
‚úÖ "The RBI increased the repo rate by how many basis points in August 2025?"
‚úÖ "Who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2024?"
‚úÖ "India signed a Free Trade Agreement with which country in July 2025?"
‚úÖ "What was the theme of World Economic Forum 2025?"
‚úÖ "The Government launched which scheme for MSME financing in June 2025?"

**MANDATORY JSON FORMAT:**

CRITICAL RULES:

Extract information ONLY from the provided current affairs content
